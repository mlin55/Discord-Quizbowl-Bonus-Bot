The exact start and end of stylistic eras in Western classical music are often difficult to pin down. For 10 points each, name some historic events that music historians have used as benchmarks for those dates.
Beethoven started the transition from the Classical to the Romantic eras with the publication of this third symphony originally dedicated to Napoleon Bonaparte. This symphony’s nickname also names his “middle period.”
1750 is sometimes declared to be the beginning of the Classical era due to this event, which caused a work with a D-minor fugue subject and several increasingly complex “Contrapunctus” movements to be left unfinished.
This event was supposedly attended by Camille Saint-Saëns, though a composer later denied Saint-Saëns’s attendance. That composer had rehearsed his two-piano score with Debussy prior to this event at the Théâtre des Champs-Elysées [“TAY-ah-truh day shawmps-elly-ZAY”].

Triads of this quality contain an interval of four half steps followed by an interval of three half steps, such as in the chord formed by C, E, and G. This quality, often thought to sound happy, is contrasted with minor.

 Early photography utilized this process that creates a direct positive image on a polished silver-coated copper plate. It required really long exposure times, after which the plate would be developed with mercury vapor.
