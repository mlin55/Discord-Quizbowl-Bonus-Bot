Answer the following about the applications of set theory to atonal music, for 10 points each.

Notes that are enharmonically equivalent and separated by a whole number of octaves are grouped together in twelve categories that are given this name. Allen Forte ("fort") pioneered analysis of atonal music using “sets” of these constructs that generalized the notion of chords.
Given any pitch class set, one can also create this bracketed list that shows how many times each interval, up to the size of a tritone, appears in the set. All larger intervals are inverted when creating this construct, so for the major scale, it is “2, 5, 4, 3, 6, 1.”

This native of Burano, who had earlier worked with Metastasio on many opera seria, also composed a number of harpsichord sonatas and concertos.

Albers led the aforementioned paper exercise while teaching the introductory Vorkurs (“FORE-koorss”) at this German art school founded by Walter Gropius. He also met his wife, the textile artist Anni Albers, in this institution’s glass workshop.
After the Nazis shut down the Bauhaus in 1933, Philip Johnson got Josef and Anni Albers positions in the painting program of this school. Throughout their time at this North Carolina art school, they repeatedly took trips to Mexico to study pre-Columbian art, inspiring Albers’s series Homage to the Square.

This character poses in front of a poster of a Renoir portrait and asks whether she’s prettier than it. In the final scene, she imitates her lover’s gesture of rubbing his lips with his thumb, which is itself an imitation of Humphrey Bogart.

In a series of photographs, Baldessari displayed everyday objects like a paperclip juxtaposed with phrases taken from the titles of prints from Disasters of War, a series of prints by this Spanish artist of Los Caprichos (“kah-PREE-chohss”).
In 1970, students from UCSD helped Baldessari perform this action, with him claiming afterward that he “would not make any more boring art.” After World War II, Gustav Metzger founded a movement including Jean Tinguely (“tang-guh-LEE”) that centered on art that performed this action.
In the LACMA-commissioned “Brief History of John Baldessari,” Baldessari predicts that in a hundred years, he will be remembered for art adding these things to black and white portraits. Another artist drew on hallucinations of these things to create With All My Love for The Tulips, I Pray Forever and her Obliteration Room.

The India-influenced minimalist La Monte Young composed a piece to be played in just intonation titled The Well-Tuned [this keyboard instrument]. The Hindu aesthetic concept of rasas influenced John Cage’s Sonatas and Interludes, which was composed for a type of this instrument that is “prepared” by placing objects on or between its strings.

This method of analysis is described as the search for “intrinsic meaning or content” beyond mere “knowledge of literary sources” in a 1939 book that studies humanist themes throughout the Renaissance. For 10 points each:
Name this concept that is the third level of Erwin Panofsky’s art historical method. It analyzes why an artist chose to represent textual references like Christian imagery the way they did, building on the lower level of iconography.
After writing Studies in Iconology, Panofsky wrote a book on this German Renaissance printmaker. Panofsky drew on Erasmus’s Handbook of a Christian Knight to analyze this artist’s woodcut Knight, Death, and the Devil.
While iconology was popularized by Panofsky, this art historian was the first to use the term. He established a private library in Hamburg that moved to London, and tried tracing the development of symbols through the Renaissance with his Mnemosyne (“nih-MOSS-in-ee”) Atlas, a series of wooden panels displaying over nine hundred photographs.

Often performed with gavottes, these pastoral dances are named for the French bagpipe, as they featured a constant pedal drone. One of these dances is the central movement of Handel’s sixth concerto grosso in his Opus 6.

The final two chords of a melody from one of these progressions, usually a perfect one if it ends the melody. These progressions in the middle of a melody are usually denoted as “half” ones.

Answer the following about bad fates that befell some composers’ premieres. For 10 points each,
This composer’s “Miracle” Symphony was probably not actually given its nickname because a chandelier fell down during the premiere and luckily hurt no one. That event more likely happened during a performance of his 102th symphony, preceding his Drumroll and London ones.
This conductor’s poor premiere of Rachmaninoff's first symphony completely destroyed Rachmaninoff's early career. This Russian’s own works includes the ballets Raymonda and The Seasons.
Conductor Johann von Herbeck died before premiering this symphony, so its composer had to do it himself. Dedicated to Wagner, it is the most revised of its composer’s symphonies.

This term denotes a very small interval that arises from constructing a pitch class two different ways in just intonation. The syntonic type equals 81/80, and represents the interval between four perfect fifths and two octaves, plus a major third.

Identify the following about the career of British artist James Wilson Carmichael. For 10 points each:
Carmichael was best known for painting these types of scenes, and even published a book on how to make them. Thomas Birch was the first prominent American painter of these scenes, and Princeton's Art Museum displays a Fitz Henry Lane painting in this genre set at Gloucester and shrouded in fog.
Another Carmichael book explored the art of marine painting in this medium. Thomas Girtin inaugurated the English tradition of landscapes in this medium, in which pigments are applied to the paper surface via a brush soaked with the namesake liquid.
Carmichael's painting HMS Erebus and Terror in the Antarctic is similar in theme to The Sea of Ice by this other painter. This Romantic artist's other marine-themed paintings include the allegorical The Stages of Life, in which the five differently-aged people in the foreground are contrasted with the ships in the distance.

According to Ascanio Condivi, this architect was jealous of Mike’s success in sculpture and, knowing that he wasn’t trained in fresco painting, arranged to get him the Sistine chapel job; when this man noticed how well Mike was doing, he tried to have him replaced by Raphael. This architect is best known for planning St. Peter’s Basilica.
According to Vasari, the lousy artist Bartolomeo Bandinelli was so jealous of Michelangelo that he destroyed Mike’s preparatory drawing for the Battle of Cascina, which was commissioned for this Florentine building opposite Da Vinci’s Battle of Anghiari.
