This sculptor destroyed the head of one of his statues in a fit of rage, but when threatened with beheading by its commissioner, replied that he could return a head to a statue but that his head couldn’t be returned to his body. For 10 points each:
Name this artist who started that equestrian statue, which was finished by Alessandro Leopardi. The long sides of the pedestal for that statue have three pillars each, referencing a rumor that its subject, Bartolomeo Colleoni, had three testicles.
Vasari claimed that Verrocchio gave up painting after this apprentice of his drew an angel in The Baptism of Christ more beautifully than any of Verrocchio’s prior works. This artist demonstrated ideal proportions in Vitruvian Man.
Leonardo likely modeled for Verrocchio’s statue of David, which is housed in this building. Since it was too tall for the Florence Cathedral, Michelangelo’s David was placed outside this building, but the version currently there is only a copy.

Sergei Lyapunov wrote 12 <em>Transcendental Études</em> in every sharp key to “complete” this composer’s plan to write 24 études in all the major and minor keys. For 10 points each:
Name this virtuoso pianist who wrote the études “Mazeppa” and “Un sospiro” and 19 Hungarian Rhapsodies.
Chopin, Scriabin, and Shostakovich’s preludes in all 24 keys use the circle-of-fifths order, alternating major and minor keys. In that scheme, this key comes last, while in Bach’s chromatically-ordered Well-Tempered Clavier, it comes in 6th.
B-flats permeate the first three of Debussy’s 24 preludes, which are not in all 24 keys, but are vaguely grouped. This second prelude in Book 1 has an ambiguous French title and key, opens with hazy descending major thirds, and only uses whole tones, except for 6 pentatonic bars in the middle.

Name these works that were often created using techniques like opus sectile or opus vermiculatum. A work of this type depicts a ferocious black dog alongside the words “Cave Canem” (“KAH-vay KAH-nem”), or “Beware of the Dog.”
This decorative style of opus sectile work, named for a family who specialized in mosaics, is characterized by beautiful inlays of highly detailed triangles and rectangles. The pavement in front of the High Altar of Westminster Abbey was made in this style; that pavement inspired the tiling in The Ambassadors.

Like Bartók’s Rhapsody No. 1, the final dance, “Mărunțel” (“muh-roont-SELL”), mixes this “sharpest” mode with another mode of a similar name. This mode is built by raising the fourth degree of a major scale or taking 7 white keys starting from F.
The “acoustic scale,” named for its similarity to the overtone series, mixes Lydian and Mixolydian qualities, and is the fourth mode of this scale. When this type of minor scale ascends from G, the set of accidentals is B-flat, E-natural, and F-sharp.

Unlike Schoenberg’s jagged music, Harmonielehre teaches Bruckner’s “law of the shortest way,” a convention for smooth voice leading in this musical texture of most Renaissance choral music. It developed from organum and consists of multiple independent voices in counterpoint.
Caplin’s Classical Form builds upon Schoenberg in dividing a sentence into a presentation and a continuation phrase. The latter may break a theme into its component motives, called “fragmentation,” or reduce a melody to its essential form, stripping away all that is unique about it, in this technique Schoenberg coined in his Fundamentals.

A non-baseball Miguel Cabrera created a major series of these paintings, which were somewhat ironically pioneered by the <em>mestizo</em> Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz and the Afro–Mexican José de Ibarra. For 10 points each:
Name these paintings or series from Early Modern New Spain, which depicted a complex hierarchy of various types of miscegenation. These paintings often begin by showing the birth of a mestiza and show that, given two more generations of intermarriage, you get a Spaniard again.
In another genre of painting from New Spain, these people were painted wearing floral crowns, often with medallion-shaped smaller paintings placed in front of their chest or neck. Aside from his casta paintings, Miguel Cabrera is best-known for his portrait of one of these people.
Earlier, the Spanish invaders had redirected traditional Mexican artists in this natural material to create Christian artworks. Small objects of this kind were woven into cloth or glued onto paper to make “mosaics,” while brightly-colored large ones were sewn onto leather bands to make Montezuma’s headdress.

Starting in the mid-’50s, this singer began recording an eight-volume survey of the Great American Songbook for Verve, a label founded to promote her. For 10 points each:
Name this “First Lady of Jazz,” best-known for her scat singing on songs like “A-Tisket, A-Tasket.”
During the classic 1960 Ella in Berlin concert, Fitzgerald forgot the lyrics to this song, improvising with lines like “Ah, Louis Miller… oh… something about cash. / Yeah… Miller… he was spending that trash” and mentioning earlier jazz performers of this song, like Bobby Darin.
Ella in Berlin then ends with a version of this jazz standard, including references to Charlie Parker’s contrafact of this song, “Ornithology.” Les Paul and Mary Ford’s hit 1951 recording of this song is often cited as a key influence on early Rock and Roll.

For 10 points each—answer the following about music theory… Classical Turkish music theory:
Turkish music theory divides the octave into 53 of these intervals. In Western music theory, this term refers to the micro-interval between two different tunings of the same pitch, such as the “Pythagorean” one produced by going around a full circle of justly-tuned perfect fifths.
Turkish and Arabic music theory sometimes measure intervals using the strings of an oud [ood], a member of this family of pear-shaped string instruments, which include the Chinese pípá. Unlike guitars, they have rounded backs.
Dave Brubeck’s “Blue Rondo à la Turk” is based on a Turkish rhythmic pattern called aksak, which divides nine beats into this grouping, as opposed to the conventional Western way of grouping nine beats as 3 plus 3 plus 3.

This concerto opens with the orchestra playing the unison, midtempo notes [read slowly] “E [pause] D-B” to open a four-bar ritornello that’s followed by a cadenza beginning with the very low half-note triplets [read slowly] “D E F D-sharp.” For 10 points each:
Name this A-minor concerto whose slow movement is unusually in the major subdominant of D. The main theme of its last movement is mainly in the rhythm “long, short-short,” beginning: [read slowly] “A [pause] E-E-D-sharp [pause] D-D-C [pause] B-B-A.”
Like much of his music for strings, the solo parts of Brahms’s Double Concerto make liberal use of this technique, in which the player bows two or more strings simultaneously. Either the general term or the terms for playing on two, three, or four strings is acceptable.
The Double Concerto was Brahms’s last orchestral work; his penultimate piece for orchestra, the fourth symphony, prominently features this colorful percussion instrument in its scherzo. This instrument has a solo at the beginning of the third movement of Liszt’s first piano concerto.

The opening of this opera’s prelude was plagiarized by Smetana for the dance of the mermaids in “The Moldau.” For 10 points each:
Name this opera whose heroine narrates a dream about a literal knight in shining armor in the soliloquy “Einsam in Trüben Tagen” [EYEN-zahm in TREW-ben TAH-gen]. It was its composer’s first “music drama,” meaning that it lacks recitatives or even traditional arias.
The most famous excerpt from Lohengrin is a “Chorus” that’s often used as a processional at these occasions. Mendelssohn’s incidental music to A Midsummer Night’s Dream includes a “March” celebrating one of these events.
The first statement of the Grail Theme at the beginning of the Lohengrin Prelude uses this somewhat uncommon notational device on the first long note. In Baroque music, something like this notational device is thought to be implied in the slow sections of French overtures, which is why performers “sharpen” their rhythms.

After its opening trumpets-and-drums fanfare, this piece continues with a sequence, with the baseline in the unison bassoons and a chain of suspensions in the horns. For 10 points each:
Name this piano concerto, its composer’s first to use clarinets. Unusually for its composer at the time, it wasn’t written as part of a pair or group of three, instead being composed almost 8 months after a pair of concertos in D minor and C major.
Robert Levin and Kristen Bezuidenhout [buh-TSOW-den-howt] have both recorded that concerto on this early keyboard instrument. This is the usual modern term for the instruments of Stein, Schantz, and other keyboards that Mozart performed on.
Levin is one of the many musicians who have attempted to complete this Mozart choral work. Constanze Mozart commissioned this piece’s first completion from Mozart’s student Franz Xaver Süssmayr.

When decorated with liernes, these architectural features are called “stellate” due to their star-like appearance. For 10 points each:
Name these arch-like components of traditional church ceilings, each of which covers one “bay.” Romanesque naves are often covered by the “barrel” type of them, while, in King’s College Chapel, they’re decorated with “fans” of ribs.
The fan vaults of King’s College Chapel exemplify this latest of the three major styles of English Gothic architecture. This style, which is analogous to the mainland’s Flamboyant Gothic, succeeded the Decorated style.
Typically, the most ornate set of ribs in a Gothic cathedral will be found in the vault at this location. English cathedrals often placed a tower over this bay of the church.

Give this term used for peoples like the Efé and the Aka, whose complex contrapuntal music is often considered one of the most intricate examples of non-European polyphony.
Like pygmy polyphony, Javanese gamelan is highly stratified. In gamelan, the basic melody, or balungan is played by instruments like the saron, while instruments of this type play rhythmic subdivisions. These instruments are often suspended vertically, and they usually have a central “nipple,” except for the flat tam-tam.
Both pygmy polyphony and gamelan music are built on repeating metric cycles. These metric cycles of Indian music are ignored during an alapana, and are typically brought out by instruments like a mridangam or a pair of tablas.

The Miles Davis songs “Tune-Up” and “Solar” [soh-LAHR] are built entirely from chains of this chord progression. For 10 points each:
Name this basic chord progression in jazz, most commonly seen as cadential formula or turnaround. This three-chord progression is often preceded by vi [“six”], as in Rhythm changes or the Ragtime progression.
Davis wrote those songs after taking three semesters of music theory at this conservatory, where jazz theorist John Mehegan later taught. Nina Simone briefly studied at this New York conservatory, whose jazz department is now led by the arch-conservative Wynton Marsalis.
A common way to spice up a ii–V–I progression is to perform this technique on the V [“five”] chord, which turns the baseline into the chromatic slide ii–♭II–I [“two, flat-two, one”]. This technique is based on the fact that a harmonically distant pair of dominant seventh chords, like G-7 and D-flat-7, happen to share two pitches, which in this case are F and B.

The vertical tablero sections of monuments at Teotihuacan were often painted in a variety of bright colors, a practice given this generic name. Notoriously, Classical European sculptures and temples were actually decorated in this fashion rather than being pure white.
Artisans at Teotihuacan also produced a number of highly elaborate “mosaic” objects of this kind, which were both worn in ritual and used as funerary offerings. Olmec craftsmen, by contrast, usually made these items out of solid pieces of jade.

Later in life, Fauré based his first two song cycles, including five songs “of Venice,” on the poetry of this man. A poem by this man inspired the uses of the word “Bergamasque” by Fauré and Debussy.
This is the Verlaine poem that invokes “Masques et Bergamasques,” thus inspiring the namesake third movement of Debussy’s Suite bergamasque. Fauré included a song based on this poem in his Opus 46.

Name this first European author to write extensively about the use of egg tempera in painting, doing so in his Il libro dell’arte, sometimes translated as The Craftsman’s Handbook.
In his discussion of this pigment, Cennini warned that unless it is tempered or mixed with oil, it tends to decompose into elemental mercury and turn black. Titian made heavy use of this cinnabar-based scarlet pigment, which was later replaced by the less toxic cadmium red.
Cennini also recommended the use of white lead as an undercoat in the finishing stages of fresco-secco. This later artist’s decision to use that technique throughout his work on a painting in the refectory of the Santa Maria delle Grazie caused it to start peeling off the wall almost immediately.

Name these highly melismatic chants exemplified by the Easter chant Haec dies. The name of this genre is used metonymously to title the standard collections of chants for the Latin Mass, a tradition that was followed in a set of motet books by William Byrd.
This composer used the graduals “Sederunt principes” and “Viderunt omnes” as the bases for two massive four-part organa. Anonymous IV claimed that this man “improved” the work of his predecessor, presumably by writing pieces with more parts.
The majority of graduals are in the fifth one of these pitch systems, although a well-known group named for the chant Justus ut palma is in the second one.

This 1624 emblem book by the Jesuit priest Herman Hugo was the best-known emblem book of the 17th century. It shares its title with a 1675 work in which Philipp Spener first outlined the principles of Pietism.
While emblems largely fell out of fashion prior to 1800, this 20th century artist collaborated with G.J. Hoogewerff to produce twenty-four of them for a 1931 collection. In a lithograph self-portrait, this artist depicted himself reflected in a sphere held by his own hand.

The final movement of a B-flat major piece in this genre is a Hornpipe stolen from Gottlieb Muffat’s <em>Componimenti Musicali</em>. For 10 points each:
Name this genre of the works collected as Handel’s Opus 3 and 6. Francesco Geminiani added an extra viola for his works in this genre, and his student Charles Avison arranged 12 Scarlatti sonatas as works in this genre.
Geminiani is probably more important for his 1751 book Art of Playing on the Violin, which is famously conservative when compared to this man’s influential 1756 Treatise on violin playing.
Geminiani and Leopold Mozart especially disagree on the handling of this part of the instrument, which is controlled by the player’s right hand. Later in the 18th century, François Tourte added a screw to the end of this device to adjust its tension.

Name these highly melismatic chants exemplified by the Easter chant Haec dies. The name of this genre is used metonymously to title the standard collections of chants for the Latin Mass, a tradition that was followed in a set of motet books by William Byrd.
This composer used the graduals “Sederunt principes” and “Viderunt omnes” as the bases for two massive four-part organa. Anonymous IV claimed that this man “improved” the work of his predecessor, presumably by writing pieces with more parts.
The majority of graduals are in the fifth one of these pitch systems, although a well-known group named for the chant Justus ut palma is in the second one. Renaissance and medieval misinterpretations of Greek music theory have led us to describe a C major scale beginning on D as the “Dorian” one of these things.

Artists like Élisabeth Vigée-Le Brun and her father Louis Vigée made numerous works in this medium, which was hugely popular for portraits in the 18th century. Chardin used this medium throughout the last decade of his life.
This Venetian painter helped popularize the use of pastels as a medium, through her prolific production of miniature portraits for a variety of international clients. Her paintings also helped popularize the Rococo style of her friend Watteau.
At the behest of Marie-Antoinette, Vigée-Le Brun, Adélaïde Labille-Guiard, and two other women portraitists were all admitted to France’s institution of this kind on the same day in 1783. The founding president of England’s institution of this kind promoted the “Grand Style” in his Discourses.

This Maurice Ravel piece never actually turned into a ballet, because Diaghilev rejected it. Ravel's program claims that this piece is supposed to depict a mass of couples performing the title dance at an imperial court around 1855.

19th-century composers loved to stretch the limits of sonata form. For 10 points each:
This long, very difficult solo piano piece in F minor by Chopin uses a hybrid between sonata form and theme and variations. Another Chopin piece in the same genre alternates between placid F-major and stormy A-minor sections.

Name this painter, who worked with his brother-in-law, Simone Martini, on an Annunciation including St. Margaret and St. Anansus.
Unless you believe Vasari, Martini was probably the pupil of this leading Sienese artist. His Maesta altarpiece was tragically sawn in half in 1711 and was originally painted for the Siena Cathedral.

Name this characteristic of much vocal music from the 13th through 15th centuries, often involving more than one language. Machaut used an extreme version of this technique in pieces like "Sans cuer/Amis/Dame" and "Quant Theseus/Ne quier," which have almost completely unintelligible lyrics.
This composer wrote many polytextual motets, such as the six-part "Vos qui admiramini/Gratissima virginis species." Many of his pieces are found in the Roman de Fauvel, and he probably wrote the treatise Ars nova notandi.
One of the innovations of the Ars Nova was imperfect mensuration, the sign for which looks like a "C." That sign, which is often misunderstood to stand for "common time," is now used to denote a measure with this number of beats.

This artist and student of Michelangelo was so incompetent that he couldn't even adequately copy his master's Epifania. For 10 points each:
Name this writer who wrote a life of Michelangelo to counter some false claims by Vasari. Unfortunately, he also introduced several errors to glorify Michelangelo, such as declaring him completely self-taught.
Condivi propaganda aside, Michelangelo was taught by this artist, who painted the Last Supper in the Ognissanti of Florence and helped paint the Stories of Moses and Stories of Jesus on the walls of the Sistine Chapel.
Vasari was hardly critical of Michelangelo, calling this statue "a miracle" and "perfection that nature is scarcely able to create in the flesh." It shows a man with a sling over his shoulder preparing to battle Goliath.
