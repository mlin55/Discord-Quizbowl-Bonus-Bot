Taglioni was the first to dance in this manner, which was likely why her tutu for La Sylphide was cut at the ankles. Special namesake shoes are used to dance in this manner, in which the weight is placed on the tips of one’s toes.
Isadora Duncan was known as much for dancing in bare feet as for wearing this accessory. Vaslav Nijinsky used one of these clothing items to mime masturbation, causing consternation at the premiere of Afternoon of a Faun.

In 1888, Gauguin stayed with this other artist at the Yellow House in Arles (“arl”), where scholars believe he may have cut off this artist’s ear. This Dutch-born artist painted The Starry Night.

Name this 1906 programmatic work for chamber orchestra. A “street band” plays the Washington Post March and pianos duel with quotations of “Hello Ma Baby” to evoke ragtime in this piece by Charles Ives.
“Hello Ma Baby” was originally a racist “coon song.” Like members of minstrel shows, performers of coon songs often used this controversial cosmetic technique to get in character.
Ragtime was repopularized by the 1971 movie The Sting, which uses this Scott Joplin rag as a theme. This song, which may refer to James Brown’s mandolin playing, is somewhat easier than the “Maple Leaf Rag.”

The music of Nadia Boulanger’s sister Lili is considered to be part of this movement, whose music contains parallel motion, heavy chromaticism, and an emphasis on colorful timbre (“TAM-burr”). For 10 points each:
Name this broad art movement. The compositions of Claude Debussy and Maurice Ravel are considered exemplary of both symbolism and this later movement, despite their rejection of the label.
In his study, Debussy kept a koto, a zither from this country. Its other folk instruments include a pear-shaped lute called biwa, an end-blown flute called shakuhachi (“sha-koo-HA-chee”), and a large drum called taiko.
To evoke Eastern music, Debussy often used this symmetrical hexatonic scale. Since all of its notes are a major second apart, this scale lacks a leading tone and contains neither augmented intervals nor half steps.

In the 14th century, composers like Philippe de Vitry began using these signs to show how to interpret their rhythms. One of these signs shaped like a “C” eventually became the modern signature for “common time.”
The mensuration sign “circle-dot” indicated that a piece’s tempus and prolatio both had this property, meaning they divided into threes, not twos. This adjective describes intervals like fourths and fifths that are neither “major” nor “minor.”
Composers of the time expected most of these details of the music to be filled in as so-called musica ficta. This is the general term for signs that change a pitch by a half-step, or sometimes more.
