Answer the following about a recent political scandal in Pakistan.
Husain Haqqani, Pakistan's ambassador to the United States, was recalled in November 2011 following allegations that he had penned a letter to this man, the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, seeking U.S. intervention to prevent a coup.
This embattled president of Pakistan, widower of Benazir Bhutto and political patron of Haqqani, was accused of complicity by Pakistani hard-liners and in December was reported to have traveled to Dubai for treatment of heart trouble.
A coup would presumably have elevated this Chief of Army Staff, often called the most powerful man in Pakistan, to power in a fashion reminiscent of his predecessor Pervez Musharraf. Zardari's government unprecedentedly extended his term as Chief of Army staff in July 2010.
