Let's rail against the use of batting average and runs batted in as a useful metric of evaluating baseball players and discuss sabermetrics, which is the study of baseball by use of statistics, FTPE:
Sabermetrics was a term coined by this baseball writer, who works for the Red Sox. Among his inventions are Win Shares and the Pythagorean Won-Loss Theorem, which projects a team's winning percentage based on its runs scored and allowed.
As much as it pains the question writer to say, zone ratings, relative range factor, or basically any method reveals that this Yankee captain and Gold Glove shortstop is actually a really crappy fielder.
This statistic measures the value of a baseball player at the margin, comparing the number of runs the player contributes beyond a replacement-level, not average, player at the same position. It was invented by Keith Woolner.
