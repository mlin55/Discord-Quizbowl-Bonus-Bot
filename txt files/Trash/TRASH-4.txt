In the series finale of season 3 of Psych, fake psychic Shawn Spencer is challenged by Mr. Yang, a serial killer based on this famous Bay Area serial killer who was active in 60's and 70's California.  A movie based on this killer was released in 2007.
The Zodiac Killer's connection to an actual zodiac is nebulous.  Also nebulous is this constellation which was popularized in early 2011 as the "13th zodiac sign" to account for the change in the location of stars due to Earth's precession. It's rather nebulous why anyone cared.

Name some recent running backs of the NFL, for 10 points each.
This all-time rushing yard leader played for the Dallas Cowboys and Arizona Cardinals, and was the first player in NFL history to rush for 1400 yards for five consecutive years. He is one of two non-kickers to score 1000 points in a career.
One of the most prolific pass-catchers out of the backfield from the running back position was this St. Louis Ram, who is the only player to run for 100 or more touchdowns and also catch 30 or more of them.
Half-backs aren’t the only ones that can carry the ball! Name this former Tampa Bay Buccaneer, a four-time all-pro who actually regularly carried the ball and scored 71 touchdowns. He retired in 2007 after a career ending neck injury.
