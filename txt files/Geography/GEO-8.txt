Answer the following about the proto-Inuit Thule (TOO-luh) civilization, for 10 points each.
The Thule moved eastward from Alaska through the Canadian Arctic following the migration of these large mammals—specifically, the bowhead species, whose jaws have long baleen plates.

Thule whale hunters replaced people from this earlier Eskimo culture, named for a cape in Nunavut where artifacts were found and sent to Diamond Jenness. This microlithic stone-tool culture died out between AD 1150 and 1350, possibly due to climate changes during the Medieval Cool Period.
