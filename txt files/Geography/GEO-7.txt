A 2017 paper in <em>Nature</em> found that this phenomenon had affected an 800-kilometer stretch of the Great Barrier Reef. For 10 points each:
Name this phenomenon, mostly caused by rising water temperatures and ocean acidification, in which coral polyps are forced to release their algae, leaving behind a calcium carbonate skeleton that turns a distinctive white color.
This country has received international praise for its efforts to combat coral bleaching of the Mesoamerican Barrier Reef, the world’s second-largest, in an effort to protect its tourism industry that relies on ocean attractions like the Blue Hole.
Another threat to Caribbean reefs is this invasive species, a venomous fish known for its long red, white, and black fins. Conservation institutions in Honduras’ Bay Islands have launched initiatives encouraging local divers to hunt and eat these fish in order to keep their population down.

Syncretism between Hinduism and other religions in Southeast Asia is evident in the name of one city in this country. For 10 points each:
Name this country, where that city’s name derives from that of the birthplace of the hero Rama. This country still maintains a Brahman temple in its capital near a disused giant red swing once used in an annual ceremony.
This Cambodian temple complex was originally dedicated to Vishnu, with its five towers representing the five peaks of Mt Meru, but it developed into a Buddhist pilgrimage site, as attested by 17th-century Japanese graffiti.
Syncretism between Hindu and Buddhist beliefs is also apparent on this Indonesian island, where Shiva-Buddha was central to Tantric traditions. Unlike Java, where there was a later move towards Islam, this island remains majority Hindu.

These people descended from the Thule [thoo-li] culture, and they are referred to as ‘skraelings’ in Norse sources about Greenland and Newfoundland. For 10 points each:
Name this indigenous people, considered distinct from the rest of the First Nations, who settled Alaska and northern Canada up to the Arctic Circle around the year 1,000 CE.
The ancestors of the Inuit split from this other indigenous group around 3,000 BCE. These people developed the baidarka, a specialized kayak designed for transportation and hunting in the waters around their namesake western Alaskan islands.
Unlike the Aleuts, this Paleo-Eskimo culture was replaced by the Inuit when the Inuit developed the use of dogs as transport animals. Inuit myth alternately describes members of this culture as ‘giants’ and ‘dwarves’, and one of its settlements survived on an island in Hudson Bay into the twentieth century

This island in the East River between Queens and the Bronx is home to a notorious jail complex, which the New York City Council voted in 2019 to close down by 2026.
More than one million people, mostly infants and homeless or other indigent people who died in hospital, are buried in trenches in this island’s vast City Cemetery. In the 1980s, the city’s first AIDS victims were buried here in separate graves for fear that the disease might contaminate other corpses.

Name this theory of geography put forward by Halford Mackinder, predicting that whichever power ruled Eastern Europe would command a namesake region stretching from the Volga to the Yangtze.
In Mackinder’s theory, the ruler of the Heartland would consequently gain power over this other entity, comprised of Africa and Eurasia. Heartland Theory holds that, since this entity hosts well over half the world’s resources, control of it would mean global power for the holder.
Excluded from the World-Island are the outlying islands, consisting of the Americas and Australia, and the offshore islands, including the Japanese and this other group of islands, formerly attached to the continent by Doggerland.

Deserts and xeric shrublands like the Nullarbor and this South American high plateau are often sparsely inhabited by humans and other fauna. Humans have settled in this driest desert on earth for the purposes of mining sodium nitrate and copper, while Andean flamingos live in its salt flats.
