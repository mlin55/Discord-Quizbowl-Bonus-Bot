Give this surname of an anthropologist who, in Knowledge and Passion, described how gaining the right to wear red hornbill earrings via headhunting was nearly a prerequisite for marriage among the Ilongot people.
The Ilongots live in this Asian country, many of whose indigenous Lumad people are ruled by nobles called Datus. A longstanding controversy concerns this country’s Tasaday people, whom some anthropologists claim were paid to take on the appearance of a peaceful foraging tribe.

The Koulibaly and Ngolosi dynasties formed this empire partly in response to arma raids. This empire, whose name served as a generic term for “pagan,” arranged its division of labor by age cohorts called ton, and ruled much of Mali and Songhai’s former territory until its capital of Ségou fell to Umar Tall.

This man led a conspiracy with Louis de Bourbon, the Duc de Bouillon, and Gaston d’Orléans against Cardinal Richelieu, but was defeated at the Battle of La Marfée.
In this scandal, Madame de Montespan and other women fighting for the title of Louis XIV’s main mistress were implicated in black masses and in the sale by “La Voisin” of illicit “inheritance powders.”

Identify this historian who wrote The Dutch Republic: Its Rise, Greatness and Fall 1477–1806. He has since written a massive trilogy contrasting “moderate” and “radical” camps during the Enlightenment.
Israel’s book identifies this decade as the starting point of the peculiar Dutch trend for de-urbanization, rejecting the alternative view that places it a decade earlier. In this decade, William of Orange took the British throne in the Glorious Revolution.
In addition to being Prince of Orange, William held this title from 1672. This title was abolished in 1795 with the foundation of the short-lived Batavian Republic.

Answer the following about campaign contributions by individuals to U.S. elections, for 10 points each.
Using data from the online tool ActBlue, Bernie Sanders announced that his 2016 presidential campaign had an average individual donation of this shockingly small number of whole dollars. It’s also the number of amendments in the U.S. Constitution.
This 2-syllable term refers to rich people who dodge the spirit of individual donation limits by gathering maxed-out individual donations from lots of other rich people they know. The “Super Rangers” were a set of them who aided the 2004 Bush campaign.
In 2014, this 5-4 party-line Supreme Court decision left up an individual contribution limit of $2,700 per election, but struck down “aggregate limits” on how much an individual can donate across any number of separate elections per two-year cycle.

The “Athenian Empire” mainly grew out of the possessions of a “League” centered on this Aegean island. The 454 B.C. transfer of the League’s treasury from this island to Athens symbolized Athens’ growing imperialism.
Another result of growing Athenian imperialism was the 465 B.C. siege of this island, which had sought to renounce membership in the Delian League. Following its defeat, this island was deprived of access to its silver deposits on the Thracian mainland.
Despite its neutrality, Athens demanded that this island join the Delian League in 416 B.C. The Athenian envoys reportedly told this island’s inhabitants that “the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they must.”

In Nebbia v. New York, the Court ruled that a state-imposed milk price did not violate this provision of the 5th and 14th Amendments, which restricts the state’s ability to arbitrarily deprive citizens of “life, liberty or property.”
In United States v. Carolene Products Co., the Court found that a ban on interstate shipping of filled milk passed this loosest standard of judicial review, but set the groundwork for the more stringent “strict scrutiny” in a footnote.
The 1951 case Dean Milk Co. v. City of Madison applied this interpretation of the Commerce Clause, which prohibits states from passing laws that discriminate against interstate commerce.

Name this neologism whose only historical source is a single New York Daily News article sardonically stating that this thing “steamed open at 12:45,” in reference to protests against a man who had denounced “attempts to make racial origins or religious beliefs the test of fitness for public office.”
The Post article examines how the term “Klanbake” has disingenuously been applied to the 1924 Democratic National Convention, which took 103 ballots to nominate this prominent attorney, who had denounced the KKK.
The overbearing Klan presence during the 1924 RNC in this city pressured Republicans never to raise a campaign plank denouncing the Klan. The 2016 RNC in this Ohio city also had a small Klan presence.

Answer the following about crowns of thorns in history, for 10 points each:
The last emperor of the Latin Empire, who had this name, sold Louis IX a relic of the crown of thorns. Another ruler of this name became the first King of Jerusalem after his brother Godfrey of Bouillon (“boo-YOHN”) stated that “he would never wear a crown of gold where his Saviour had worn a crown of thorns.”
William Jennings Bryan ended a famous 1896 speech supporting bimetallism with the line “You shall not press down upon the brow of labor this crown of thorns; you shall not crucify mankind upon a cross of” this material.
A flag featuring a red crown of thorns is used by a Liberation League for this social class, who lived in their own hamlets and were called eta in feudal times.

This Methodist and other itinerant preacher delivered numerous sermons during the Great Awakening. Contemporary sources note that this cross-eyed member of the “Holy Club” could make listeners weep by merely saying the word “Mesopotamia” in a booming voice.
In 1740, the popularity of Whitefield’s sermons led Edmund Woolley to design a meetinghouse that was then the largest building in the colonies. The meetinghouse later became the nucleus of this institution, many of whose later buildings were designed by the Cope &amp; Stewardson company.

Arnaldo Momigliano (“moh-mee-lee-AH-noh”) argues that this writer’s extensive use of documents inaugurated a new type of historiography. For 10 points each:
Name this fourth-century Christian writer who used documents from the Library of Caesarea (“see-zuh-REE-uh”) to trace the development of early Christianity in his Church History. He is also known for writing an extremely favorable biography of Constantine the Great.
According to Momigliano, Eusebius’s use of documents differentiates his work from that of this other writer, who frequently invented speeches and used his own experiences and discussions with witnesses to write about events like the Funeral Oration and conquest of Melos.
Momigliano also argues that Eusebius treated Christians as a nation, an idea which became increasingly popular during the period denoted by this two-word term. It is commonly used to denote the period of cultural transition which bridges the classical and medieval European worlds, and was popularized by Peter Brown in his 1971 book on “The World of” this era, which covers 150 to 750 AD.

Other than superior firepower, Prussian troops held a decisive advantage over their Austrian counterparts at Königgrätz because they followed this military doctrine of “flexible command.” Soldiers were expected to improvise and act on their own initiative as part of this doctrine.

During the French Revolution, Philidor famously wrote that these pieces “are the soul of chess.” Philidor pioneered the study of the structure of these pieces, which are generally strong in chains but weak when isolated or backward.
The Romantic era of chess paralleled Romanticism in the arts by emphasizing intuitive tactical play rather than rational strategic play. Thus, these sacrificial openings like the King’s and the Evans were popular, although many are now considered unsound.
This school of chess arose in the interwar era in opposition to the classical school. It was inaugurated by Aron Nimzowitsch’s My System and advocated controlling the center from a distance rather than occupying it with pawns.

This ideology was the basis of the Republican party's opposition to slavery, since it held that the interests of employers and workers are aligned.
Eric Foner argues that this self-improving ideology was the foundation of the Freedmen's Bureau and that it found expression in Abraham Lincoln's life story, since he had once been a rail-splitter.
Foner traced the free labor ideology in part to this conflict, which occurred in the counties around Albany beginning in 1839. In 1846, the movement growing out of this conflict successfully unseated governor Silas Wright.
Foner further argued that Reconstruction failed because of the flaws inherent in free labor, which are evident in the reception of the former abolitionist James Pike's widely-circulated attack on this state's Reconstruction government, The Prostrate State.
