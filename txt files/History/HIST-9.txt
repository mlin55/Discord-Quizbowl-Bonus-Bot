Under this kind of system, which was essential to Ottoman financial administration, a key government function would be auctioned to the highest bidder.

Proponents of a literal interpretation of this word draw on sources such as Epaminondas yelling “one pace more!” at Leuctra to claim that the tactic it describes was akin to a rugby scrum. For 10 points each:
Name this Greek word for a style of hoplite combat, which has led to debate between historians who hold that the pushing it refers to was a literal shoving match of shields and those who argue it was metaphorical.
The othismos style used in hoplite battles occurred between these rectangular formations of soldiers, whose first row locked their shields together as they marched.
Proponents of the “literal model” also point to Xenophon’s mention of how “shield pressed upon shield they struggled” in his account of this war’s Battle of Coronea.

The draining of the Fens was the largest of the land reclamation projects that helped spur this period of innovation by creating large areas of arable farmland. Four-course crop rotation was introduced during this period.

Another, non-fascist variant of syndicalism popular in Second Republic Spain was the anarcho-syndicalism of this trade union, which basically ran Barcelona until government forces defeated it and the POUM during the 1937 May Events.
The clandestine Workers’ Commissions that organized workers outside of Franco’s Vertical Syndicate was supported by this organization. Opus Dei, an institution for lay members of this organization, supplied many of the technocrats in Franco’s government.

Jack Weatherford’s book about the Mongol queens is titled in reference to this mythologized account of Genghis Khan’s family lineage. The female characters of this Mongolian-language text include Alan Gua, who gives her sons a bundle of five arrows to demonstrate the value of unity.
This historian apologized to his readers for discussing women in his history of the Mongols, but explained that it was necessary since the Mongols accorded equal treatment to women. This Persian vizier of the Ilkhanate produced the Compendium of Chronicles, which is often called the first world history.

William Douglass attacked Cotton Mather during a 1721 epidemic of this disease for promoting an inoculation method that Mather learned from his slave Onesimus. For 10 points each:
Name this disease, which was transmitted through infected blankets to the Delaware by a besieged British militia at Fort Pitt in 1767.
This Native American tribe attributed the smallpox epidemic of the late 1730s to the spread of tiny evil spirits called Kosvkv Askini and tried to combat it by modifying their Atohvna Ceremony, which involved a purifying rite of “Going-to-Water” to gain the Long Man’s powers.
Recent work on Native Americans’ encounters with disease has challenged this historian’s “virgin soil” model of infection, which argues that lack of genetic immunity is the main reason diseases like smallpox were so deadly for native populations. This historian coined the term “Columbian Exchange” in a 1972 book of that title.

Early attempts to develop a print culture in Hawai’i were hampered by a chronic shortage of metal casts of this common word-beginning consonant in written Hawaiian, in part because it was chosen by missionaries to replace the letter “T” in the newly developed alphabet.

The ritsuryō legal regime grew out of this series of reforms implemented by the Emperor Kōtoku during the Asuka period.
The bureaucratic ranking system of ritsuryō was prefigured by the China-inspired twelve-level cap-rank system established by this prince. A seventeen-article constitution is also credited to this prince, and the Taika reforms were written shortly after his death.

Germanization of the Polish-speaking people of Posen was an official part of this campaign of Bismarck’s, which included the May Laws instituted by Adalbert Falk.
This Polish ethnic group targeted by the Germanization program was later one of the few labeled as capable of Germanization by the Nazis, an effort they did little to comply with; nonetheless, many members of this ethnic group centered in Pomerania were expelled along with the Germans after the war.

In Roman Britain, the Iceni tribe’s resentment of the seizure of their land for the veteran’s colony at Camulodunum led it to be the first target of this queen’s revolt.

This people’s system of arithmetic lacked the concept of abstract numbers, so different words were used to indicate two items that made a pair, two unrelated items, two items bound together, and so on. For 10 points each:
Name these people who used an abacus-like tool called the yupana. The knotted strings carried by messengers among these people are sometimes thought to encode base-ten numbers.
The use of knotted strings, or quipu, for record-keeping may have originated in this culture with a capital at Chan Chan. Pachacuti’s expansion of the Inca state allowed it to conquer this successor to the Moche culture.
The quipus felt under greatest Spanish scrutiny after this millenarian movement with a name meaning “dancing sickness” broke out in the 16th century. The extent to which this movement terrified Spanish clerics is suggested by the fact that Juan Bocanegra included a questionnaire about it in his Quechua-language songbook 60 years later.

As part of agreeing to its previously established national boundaries, Ethiopia will return control of this hotly contested border town in its Tigray Region to Eritrea. The invasion of this town in 1998 by Eritrean forces precipitated the Eritrean–Ethiopian War.

That Solon poem survives through its quotation in Constitution of the Athenians, a work usually attributed to this author who defended natural slavery in his Politics.

Smith was originally ordained by the International Church of the Foursquare Gospel, an evangelical denomination founded by this religious leader, who preached at the Angelus Temple and notoriously claimed she was kidnapped in 1926 and held hostage in Mexico.

Khal Torabully is from this island country, where the plurality of Indian indentured laborers were sent to work on sugar plantations. The dodo was hunted to extinction on this island.

According to Benjamin’s account, the Jewish communities in Greek cities such as Corinth and Thebes focused on this industry, which was brought to the Byzantine empire by the smuggling efforts of two Nestorian monks.
Some years after his death, the main street of Tudela’s one of these neighborhoods was named in Benjamin’s honor. This term of Arabic origin was used in medieval Spanish and Portuguese documents to denote self-governing communities of Jews and Moors within Iberia.

Unusual for a Roman domus, the House of the Vettii is missing this specific kind of room, which in most Roman domus or villas served as the office or study of the paterfamilias and was situated between the atrium and the peristyle. These rooms were named after the board or slate upon which transactions would be recorded.

Pérez Alfonzo worked under this two-time Venezuelan president, guiding his administration into co-founding OPEC. His refusal to recognize any government that arose via coup sparked the ire of Rafael Trujillo, who attempted to assassinate him by car bomb.

Butler and Stead’s efforts led to the 1885 Criminal Law Amendment Act, whose anti-”gross indecency” Labouchere Amendment was used to convict the subjects of this 1889 scandal, in which Lord Somerset and Prince Albert Victor were accused of visiting a male brothel in London.
