According to Ian Hacking, this term implies that something appears to be inevitable, but isn't. For 10 points each:
Name this process that Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann apply to "reality." This term suggests that something is not a natural kind, and it is often applied to something to distinguish it from a "brute fact."
Books like Andrew Pickering's Constructing Quarks apply social constructionist perspectives to this discipline. Paul Feyerabend (FYE-ur-AH-bint) argued that experiments and hypotheses should not be considered essential to it.
This historian's book The Structure of Scientific Revolutions introduced the term "paradigm shift" to denote the rapid shifts in interpretation of evidence provoked by anomalies.

The Bridgewater Treatises were inspired by William Paley's book on this discipline, which uses an analogy to a watch to suggest that the physical workings of the universe imply a divine creator. For 10 points each:
Name this discipline which seeks to infer the nature of God from physical reality. The Gifford Lectures were endowed to promote the study of this discipline.
This thinker wrote a Ninth Bridgewater Treatise that defended miracles while arguing for Charles Lyell's uniformitarianism. This collaborator of Ada Lovelace proposed an early computer called an Analytical Engine.

Name this native of Colophon who argued against polytheism by observing that depictions of deities tended to match their followers, providing examples such as the pale gods of the Thracians or the black deities of the Ethiopians.
The doubtful thoughts of Xenophanes fit under the umbrella of this general philosophical position which questions the certainty of knowledge. A school with this position was founded by Pyrrho.
The philosopher al-Ghazali's skepticism led him to write The Incoherence of the Philosophers, a book that was attacked by this philosopher in The Incoherence of the Incoherence. Much like Avicenna, this philosopher interacted heavily with Aristotelian thought.

Name this kind of thing. Descartes (day-CART) defined the "created" kind of these things as those whose existence depends on nothing but God. Medieval metaphysics often thought of these things as having "modes."
As a mechanical philosopher, unlike Aristotle, Descartes believed that mental and physical substances were distinct, an example of this kind of ontology of mind.
While Descartes argued that substances could have either extension or thought, but not both, this Jewish philosopher from Amsterdam argued in his Ethics that there is only one substance with many attributes, which he called God or Nature.

Answer the following about the orthodox Mimamsa school of Hindu philosophy, for 10 points each:
The Mimamsa school was concerned with deriving a philosophy of ritual action from the first four of these foundational Hindu texts. The Upanishads are commentaries on the earlier examples of these texts, including the "Rig" one.
The Mimamsa emphasis on the early Vedas contrasted with the Vedanta school, whose Advaita and Dvaita sub-schools clashed on whether the soul is equivalent to this concept, which refers to ultimate reality.
Mimamsa philosophers like Kumarila argued that this phenomenon has no defined origin. Many twentieth century philosophers based arguments around the "ordinary" type of this phenomenon.

Arnauld's "Fourth Objections" to this work by Descartes (day-CART) dispute a passage in which Descartes writes that if cold is the absence of heat, the positive idea of cold must be a mistake. This work introduced the "evil demon" thought experiment.
Arnauld and Pierre Nicole wrote the Port-Royal textbook on this subject, also called The Art of Thinking. This formal subject is concerned with the methods of inductive and deductive reasoning.
This fellow Jansenist philosopher defended Arnauld's theology in the Provincial Letters, written under the pseudonym Louis de Montalte.

Name this Platonic dialogue about justice, which introduces the Allegory of the Cave to illustrate the theory of Forms.
While discussing justice with Glaucon, Socrates compares the illumination of the sun to the way this particular Platonic Form makes truth visible. This Form is said to be the greatest of all Forms.
In Book I of this work, Aristotle argued that the Form of the Good is so removed from everyday human affairs as to be irrelevant. This work discusses virtues like courage and justice.

Answer the following about gaps in philosophy, for 10 points each.
The idea that thoughts cannot be observed by observing the brain is sometimes known as this philosopher's "gap," since he described it in a passage in his Monadology.
The fact that physicalist theories in the philosophy of mind have trouble accounting for people's subjective experiences is often known as this kind of gap, a term coined by Joseph Levine.
This biologist criticized the so-called "god of the gaps" in his book The God Delusion. This New Atheist also wrote The Selfish Gene.

Philosophers of biology disagree about whether Darwin's theory of evolution supports or undermines this kind of causation, which is among the four posited by Aristotle. This concept refers to the purpose or end of a thing.
This man, who coined the term "agnosticism," argued from Darwinism that the mind is an epiphenomenon. He popularized evolution through his book Man's Place in Nature and debates with people like Samuel Wilberforce.

Answer some questions about Richard Rorty's sustained engagement with another thinker's works, for 10 points each:
Rorty takes this philosopher's critique of logocentrism as a claim that philosophy is just another kind of writing in an essay that comments on this man's books Of Grammatology and Writing and Difference.
Rorty discusses how Derrida's The Postcard displays this attitude in a book titled for contingency, solidarity, and it. Søren Kierkegaard's doctoral thesis probed Socrates's use of this attitude.
In Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity, Rorty compared Derrida's critique of Heidegger to Heidegger's critique of this philosopher, who wrote that "God is dead" in The Gay Science.

Answer the following about the ancient Athenian philosopher Cratylus, for 10 points each:
In the Platonic dialogue Cratylus, Cratylus and Hermogenes contend, respectively, that these things are either purely natural or purely conventional. The Confucian doctrine of zhengming (jung-meeng) is often translated to English as the "rectification" of these things.
In response to Cratylus's contention that studying names is the best way to understand what they designate, Socrates invokes the theory of these abstract, eternal entities, of which empirical things are just copies.
Aristotle reported that Cratylus eventually became such a radical follower of this pre-Socratic philosopher that he extended one of this man's aphorisms to claim that one cannot step into a river even once.

Answer the following about words in philosophy, for 10 points each.
The type–token distinction, in which some words represent abstract concepts and others represent concrete examples of those concepts, was elucidated by this pragmatist who wrote "How To Make Our Ideas Clear" and "The Fixation of Belief".
This philosopher asserted that words could be used in performative utterances or illocutionary speech acts to change the reality they are describing, rather than merely describing it, in his aptly-titled book How To Do Things With Words.
W. V. O. Quine's book Word and Object examines the indeterminacy of this linguistic process, using a thought experiment about its "radical" kind in which a linguist attempts to determine whether the unfamiliar word "gavagai" actually means "rabbit". People who conduct this process have to take care to preserve the semantics of the original language.

Answer the following about experimental philosophy, which is the attempt to introduce empirical data to philosophy, for 10 points each.
Much of experimental philosophy seeks to challenge the role of these beliefs in philosophical arguments. Herman Cappelen argues they already have little role in philosophy, but Daniel Dennett describes Descartes's "I think, therefore I am" as a "pump" of them.
Experimental philosophers often criticize "armchair" philosophers' reliance on these imagined scenarios, which include the trolley problem and the Chinese room.
Weinberg, Nichols, and Stich used cross-cultural surveys to check people's intuitions about a thought experiment by Edmund Gettier that challenged Plato's definition of this concept as "justified true belief." This concept is the subject of epistemology.

Answer some questions about the sociological insights of Michel Foucault, for 10 points each.
Foucault belonged to both this late 20th-century linguistic and sociological movement and its successor, both of which examined the ways humans operated within dominant linguistic and cultural systems. This movement had its linguistic origins in Ferdinand de Saussure.
In The Birth of the Clinic, Foucault conceived of the "medical" type of this concept, the physician's ability to see into a person's depths in order to "save" them. This term is preceded by "male" in Laura Mulvey's theory of movies casting women as erotic objects for a male viewer's pleasure.
In Discipline and Punish, Foucault analyzed the "birth of" these institutions. Jeremy Bentham had a thought experiment about one in which inmates could always be observed, the Panopticon.

Answer the following about the man who coined the term "scientist," William Whewell <strong>(HEW-el)</strong>. For 10 points each:
In this book, J. S. Mill criticized Whewell's views on induction for claiming that scientific discovery required "fundamental ideas" in the mind, not just observation. This book argues that the semantic value of a name is its referent.
Along with simplicity, Paul Thagard argued that Whewell's concept of "consilience" describes one of the two main virtues of these things, which are testable sets of scientific ideas that have withstood scrutiny. Examples include evolution and gravity.
Whewell titled one volume for "renovating" this earlier book, which he criticized for insufficient attention to actual scientists' practices. This 17th-century book dismisses four "idols" which can mislead reasoning.

Answer the following about the early Muslim philosopher Avicenna, for 10 points each.
Avicenna's belief that creation is an emanation of God comes from Aristotle's Theology, which is really not by Aristotle, but is rather a paraphrase of part of this Neo-Platonist philosopher's Enneads, which were compiled by his student Porphyry.
Avicenna's Floating Man thought experiment supports the separation of this immaterial mental entity from the body. Plotinus argued that the body has a "trace" of this thing, whose immortality Socrates defends in Plato's Phaedo.

This German rationalist philosopher coined the term "theodicy" in a book that argues that this world is the best of all possible worlds. He introduced a metaphysics built around simple monads in his Monadology.
This Jewish phenomenologist argued that theodicy is deeply immoral in the face of 20th century violence in his essay "Useless Suffering." He wrote that ethics is grounded in face-to-face encounters with the other in Totality and Infinity.

Identify this school to which Peregrinus Proteus belonged. Antisthenes is the traditional founder of this movement, whose name derives from the fact that, like dogs, adherents paid no heed to public moral standards.
This Cynic philosopher from Sinope partook in outrageous acts such as defacing Athenian coins in order to call attention to how Athenians no longer lived in step with nature. He supposedly went around with a lantern looking for an honest man.

Answer the following about the philosophical notion of <em>kenon</em>, or "void," in ancient thought, for 10 points each.
In his Letter to Herodotus, this philosopher believed that "bodies" moved in a void, since motion is not possible without "nothingness." This man taught in a school called "The Garden" and believed that pleasure was the highest good.
Epicurus believed that these entities filled the void. Both Democritus and Leucippus proposed that the universe was composed of these fundamental units.
This Roman Epicurean argued that atoms "swerved" in the void to create the "possibilities" of the universe in a long philosophical poem.

Name these kinds of Greeks. One of these people named Epimenides claimed that all of them are liars.
The liar paradox seems to contract this basic law of logic, which states that either a statement is true or its converse is. This law was first introduced in Aristotle's On Interpretation.
The law of the excluded middle is complementary to a law forbidding these statements, in which both a statement and its negation are held to be true. The principle of explosion holds that any statement can be derived from one of these.

Name this concept, which Plato investigates in the dialogue the Meno. The study of this topic in philosophy is called epistemology.
In the Meno, Socrates points out that the knowledge a slave has of the Pythagorean theorem is evidence for the theory that knowledge is immediately derived from this source. Anamnesis is the idea that knowledge comes from this source.
In this other Platonic dialogue, Socrates also argues that knowledge is merely recollection. Sometimes translated into English as On the Soul, this dialogue features the death of Socrates.

That phrase came from a lecture likening existentialism to this kind of philosophy, which lauds the power and dignity of individual people. A Renaissance philosophy of this name involved deep study of classical texts.
This Frenchman coined the phrase "existence precedes essence" in his lecture "Existentialism is a Humanism." He wrote that many people live in a state of inauthentic "bad faith" in Being and Nothingness.

According to French psychoanalytic theorist Jacques Lacan, children learn to think of themselves as beings separate from the world in a "stage" named for these objects. For 10 points each:
Name these objects. A hugely controversial book by Richard Rorty debunked the idea in prior philosophy that the mind serves as one of these for objects in nature without modifying anything.
Rorty's Philosophy and the Mirror of Nature helped revive this American school of thought, which cares about the practical consequences of holding beliefs rather than absolute truth values.
This American thinker broke with pragmatism after defining truth as that which is "ultimately agreed to by all who investigate" in his essay How to Make Our Ideas Clear.

Name this book of early modern political philosophy whose four major sections are "Of Man," "Of the Commonwealth," "Of a Christian Commonwealth," and "Of the Kingdom of Darkness."
This man, who translated Thucydides' ancient Greek histories into English at the tender age of 90, put forward his absolutist political philosophy in Leviathan.
The intro to Leviathan also coined this 2-word phrase, a metaphor likening the state or commonwealth to an individual human, organs and all.

Augustine's three-part dialogue on this concept is a dialogue between himself and a man named Evodius. For 10 points each:
Name this proposed ability of the human mind to make unrestricted choices. Determinists believe that humans do not have this, since mental decisions are pre-ordained by outside factors.
This 19th century German philosopher warned that we can do what we will, but we cannot will what we will. He also proposed that the universe consists largely of a single unknowable will which is a "thing-in-itself" apart from objects represented before our senses. He wrote On the Four Fold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason.
This is the contemporary term for people who believe that free will can exist even though physical determinism is true. The author of On Truth, Harry Frankfurt, defended this viewpoint.

Name this purported official. Philosophical sentences about him are common examples used to ascertain what happens when phrases denote a non-existent entity.
This prolific 20th century British philosopher introduced the example of the present king of France in "On Denoting." His theory of types resolves a paradox about "the set of all sets which contain themselves".
With Alfred North Whitehead, Bertrand Russell tried to axiomatize all of this academic field. Other philosophers who worked in this field include Pythagoras and Gottfried Leibniz, who respectively developed its subfields geometry and calculus.

In examining the sentence "Sally is a block of ice," this man argued that humans possess nonrepresentational mental capacities that don't rely on any underlying rules or principles. For 10 points each:
 Name this American philosopher, whose "Chinese room" thought experiment attempts to show the possibility of a system that can pass a Turing test without truly having a mind.
 The Chinese room is an attack on the "strong" variety of this research program. This field works to create machines that possess the same capacities for thought as humans do.
John Lucas used theorems by this man to support his claim that machines were necessarily limited in their potential for real thought. This man's incompleteness theorems show any theory is capable of proving its consistency if and only if it is inconsistent.

Hegel proposed that change occurs through this process, which Marxists defined as a thesis, opposed by a rival antithesis, resolving into a synthesis of the two.
Many modern academics put Hegel in the "absolute" subtype of this view that the thoughts of the individual are the basis of reality. Other Germans of the era, such as Friedrich Schelling and F.H. Jacobi, also held it.

Name this structure which, like the corpus callosum, sits between the hemispheres of the brain; for that reason, a 17th-century Frenchman believed that this part of the brain was the "seat of the soul" within the body.
This Frenchman saw the pineal gland as the center of mind-body interaction. In his Discourse on Method, he established a firm rational foundation for trusting one's senses using the axiom "I think, therefore I am."

Name this 17th-century British thinker who wrote Essay Concerning Human Understanding, which rejected the position that humans have "innate ideas" at birth.
More recent versions of the inverted spectrum problem ask if perceptions of color are among these units, the smallest individual instances of subjective conscious experience.
David Chalmers argued that different people can see the same objects with inverted colors supports this view about the nature of the mind. Gilbert Ryle opposed this view, whose earliest formulator saw a part of the brain as a refuge for "animal spirits".

This book follows a pattern of raising questions, posing objections to the premise of the question, citing an authority such as the Bible on the contrary, and giving a real reply in response to the question.
This Doctor of the Church and student of Albertus Magnus wrote Summa Theologica.

Answer the following about a 1951 paper by Willard van Orman Quine that attacked the reigning orthodoxies in philosophy, for 10 points each.
The paper is titled for two unjustified Dogmas of" this philosophical viewpoint, which supports collecting experience and evidence to form beliefs. John Locke held this belief.
One such dogma is the division between these definitionally-true statements and more complex "synthetic" truths. This adjective also names a highly logical style of English-language philosophy at odds with more freeform "Continental" theory.
The second dogma concerns this process of assessing a sentence as no more than its underlying basic logic. In philosophy of science, this process explains a higher-order process such as consciousness in terms of more basic processes such as biochemistry.

Name this type of philosophy which is assessed in the first and largest part of Immanuel Kant's Critique of Judgment.
This 19th century American liberal looked at the effects of art on the person as a "live animal" in Art as Experience. He argued that children in school should be treated with respect as future civic participants in Democracy and Education.

Name this Greek philosopher who analyzed why things are the way they are in terms of "four causes." He tutored Alexander the Great and founded the Lyceum a generation after Plato's Academy.
In discussing material versus formal causes, Aristotle claimed the claim that you can't make one of these places by just dumping a pile of bricks somewhere. In an ancient Greek polis, each male citizen ran an oikos centered around one of these places.
When people today say the verb "cause," they mean this third of Aristotle's four causes, the actual instigator which brings about an event. When building a house, the work of a builder to assemble the bricks is this type of cause.

Answer the following about Anarchy, State, and Utopia, a book which Harvard political philosopher Robert Nozick wrote to defend libertarianism, for 10 points each.
Nozick's libertarianism opposed this other Harvard philosopher, who argued that a robust, fair, liberal state would emerge if each of its founders acted as if they were behind a "veil of ignorance" about their own identity in A Theory of Justice.
Nozick argues that even a minimal "night watchman state" must prevent breaches of these documents. Thomas Hobbes defined a "covenant" as one of these which requires somebody to "perform his part at some determinate time after" in a work that examined a specific type of these things.
Nozick's libertarianism has some similarities to the "harm principle" of this earlier British author of On Liberty. This prodigy's father James raised him to propound the theory of utilitarianism.
