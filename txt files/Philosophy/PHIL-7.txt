Susan Wolf split these people into two types: ‘rational’ and ‘loving’, the latter of whom’s ‘own well-being simply consists in the well-being of others.’ For 10 points each:
Name these people, who Wolf argues in a 1982 paper would be unattractive because they lack the ‘ability to enjoy the enjoyable in life’.
Wolf uses the concept of ‘moral saints’ to criticise a moral philosophy she names for this concept. According to Aristotle, this concept requires ‘rational activity’, and as such it is sometimes translated as ‘flourishing’.
Wolf links the concept of the ‘loving’ moral saint to this ethical philosophy that was originated by Jeremy Bentham.

This philosopher distinguished between the phenomenal and access types of a concept that they called ‘a mongrel concept’. For 10 points each:
Name this philosopher, who argued against functionalism in the China brain thought experiment using the ‘absent qualia’ objection.
The absent qualia objection revolves around the notion that while the China brain would be functionally equivalent to a human brain, it would lack this concept, the subjective awareness of one's own existence.
Contrary to Block, this philosopher argued that the China brain would in fact have consciousness. This philosopher argued against the concept of qualia in Quining Qualia and characterised thought experiments as ‘intuition pumps’.

This thinker argued that identity politics often boils down to organizing around so-called “wounded attachments,” or psychic scars of oppression. For 10 points each:
Name this political theorist who put forth that claim in her book States of Injury. More recently, she analyzed “neoliberalism’s stealth revolution” in her book Undoing the Demos.
Wendy Brown is the partner of this other thinker, who similarly critiqued political organization around identities in her book The Psychic Life of Power. She’s better known for describing gender as a performative category in books like Bodies That Matter.
Both Brown and Butler often draw on this thinker’s notion of “regulative discourses,” first outlined in his book Discipline and Punish. This poststructuralist also wrote a three-volume History of Sexuality and The Order of Things.

Positions inspired by this paper include growing block theory, eternalism, and four-dimensionalism. For 10 points each:
Name this paper that attempts to create a paradox using an “A-series” and “B-series” before finding flaws in both options.
“The Unreality of Time” is by J. M. E. McTaggart, who comprised the “Mad Tea Party of Trinity College” along with Bertrand Russell and this other philosopher, who developed the idea of the “naturalistic fallacy.”
In a 1952 essay titled for a “defence” of this two-word concept, Moore famously argued that because he can see both of his hands, an external world exists. Thomas Reid founded an earlier Scottish philosophical “school” that promoted this two-word concept, influencing a 1776 pamphlet by Thomas Paine.

In one paper, this author argued against a distinction between two types of propositions, as typified by “No unmarried man is married” and “No bachelors are married,” by using synonyms. For 10 points each:
Name this philosopher who, in the same paper, extended Pierre Duhem’s idea of “underdetermination” to advance the position of “confirmational holism.”
The analytic–synthetic distinction and reductionism are the two title “dogmas” of this school of philosophy that were critiqued in that paper by Quine. John Locke was the principal advocate of this school, which argues that all knowledge originates from experience.
In “Two Dogmas of Empiricism,” Quine criticizes this philosopher’s idea of state-descriptions and L-determined statements. This Vienna Circle member wrote The Logical Constitution of the World.

In one thought experiment, this thinker postulated that smell was the sense that contributes the least to human knowledge. For 10 points each:
Name this French advocate of “sensationism,” who postulated a statue that is organized inside like a human but with a soul that has never received an idea.
Étienne Bonnot de Condillac distinguished between two different “languages of action” in a 1755 treatise on these beings. Peter Singer has more recently pushed for the “liberation” of these beings through practices like vegetarianism.
Condillac also wrote in this discipline, which he divided into two phases of progress and decline with his theory of “true price.” R. G. Collingwood wrote a book on “The Idea of” this discipline.

Name the following philosophers who have written about “irony,” for 10 points each.
In a review of Karl Solger’s posthumous writings, this thinker criticized the “Romantic irony” of Friedrich Schlegel (“SHLAY-gull”) and the “pathological irony” of Novalis as forms of “vanity.” He also wrote The Phenomenology of Spirit.
This philosopher analyzed Hegel’s discussion of irony in his dissertation, which centered on Socrates’ ironic use of what this man termed “infinite absolute negativity.”
This neo-Pragmatist thinker connected the practice of “private irony,” which maintains doubts about the viability of one’s “final vocabulary,” with “liberal hope” in a chapter of his 1989 book Contingency, Irony, and Solidarity.
Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel
Søren Kierkegaard

Bertrand Russell wrote an influential “Critical Exposition” of this man’s work, claiming that his private and public writing espoused two different philosophies. For 10 points each:
Name this German philosopher and mathematician who wrote about his belief in “windowless” substances called monads. He discovered a concept, which he called “fluxions,” concurrently with Isaac Newton.
Leibniz coined this term for attempts to solve the problem of evil. Leibniz’s work titled for this concept relies on the principle of sufficient reason and states that we are living in the “best of all possible worlds.”
Leibniz’s Theodicy is often considered a type of theodicy named for this saint, who attacked Gnosticism in his Against Heresies. This philosopher’s theodicies are based on God being omnipotent and omnibenevolent.

A 2016 book analyzes the “chromatic chatter” of these animals in relation to the evolution of language. For 10 points each:
Name these animals that are often cited as evidence for “embodied cognition,” whose consciousness is the subject of the philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith’s book Other Minds.
“Embodied cognition,” which argues that the entire body of an organism structures cognition, as opposed to just the mind, is a theory with roots in this man’s book Universal Natural History and Theory of Heaven. He also wrote the Critique of Pure Reason.
Conflicting accounts of this Ancient Greek philosopher’s death attribute it either to his eating raw octopus or fighting with a dog over a piece of octopus. Anecdotes about this man often mention his “dog-like” nature, which gave rise to the name of the philosophical school with which he is associated.

To make ethics classes more hands-on, Michael sets up a gory real-life version of this thought experiment devised by Philippa Foot. In this dilemma, you will kill five people if you do nothing, or one if you intervene.
A recurring theme in the show is “what we owe to each other,” T.M. Scanlon’s version of this view of ethics, modern proponents of which include Onora O’Neill and Christine Korsgaard. This view emphasises moral duties.
After much study, Eleanor shows Chidi how much she learned by bringing up this Oxford philosopher’s concept of moral particularism. Tahani earlier namedrops this father-in-law of Claire Danes in one of her essays.

This work opens by comparing two quotes on humanity, one from Abdala the Muslim and one from Hermes Trismegistus. For 10 points each:
Name this key work of Renaissance humanism by Giovanni Pico della Mirandola. Although Innocent VIII forbade its intended delivery in 1486, it would have served as an introduction to Pico’s 900 theses.
Pico della Mirandola and Marsilio Ficino based much of their humanism on a school of thought named for this thinker expounded in the Enneads of Plotinus. This thinker founded the famous Academy in Athens.
Neoplatonist thought, as introduced by Plotinus, is based on this central concept. The rest of the universe emanated from this concept in a sequence of lesser beings, including the Demiurge and the world-soul.

This philosopher’s constructivist ideas about mathematics led him to conclude that not all real numbers have a decimal expansion. For 10 points each:
Name this Dutch mathematician and philosopher, whose rejection of the law of the excluded middle was central to his idea of mathematical intuitionism, which clashed with Hilbert’s concept of formalism.
Both Brouwer and Hilbert disagreed with this German thinker’s “logicist” view of mathematics, in which regard he wrote The Foundations of Arithmetic and pioneered his Begriffsschrift system of logic.
Frege’s work inspired this British philosopher’s Principia Mathematica, which he co-wrote with Alfred North Whitehead. He also wrote On Denoting and A History of Western Philosophy.

Prime your intuition pumps, because it’s time to answer some questions about philosophical thought experiments. For 10 points each:
This thinker used a thought experiment about a ball of wax to argue that sense perception cannot define the essence of a thing. His Meditations on First Philosophy also contemplates whether he is being tricked by a demon.
Nelson Goodman imagined two time-dependent types of these things to posit a “New Riddle of Induction.” Frank Jackson pondered “Mary the Super-Scientist”’s knowledge of these things if she’s never seen one.
One of this thinker’s namesake “cases” defending compatibilism involves a thought experiment in which a bomb in Donald the Democrat’s brain will go off if he thinks about the Iraq War. This thinker wrote On Bullshit.

In <em>A Short History of Western Legal Theory</em>, John M. Kelly writes that this statement “gave what might be called the plain chant of natural rights, as Locke intoned them, a polyphonic charm.” For 10 points each:
Give this statement that famously opens On the Social Contract, which goes on to describe how one concept in it could be made “legitimate.” The so-called “first English feminist” anticipated this quote sixty years earlier.
This “first English feminist” asked “if all men are born free, how is it that all women are born slaves?” in 1703’s Some Reflections on Marriage. She proposed a women’s college to further equal educational opportunities.
Astell probably would have criticised this thinker’s proposals that women be educated for attractiveness and domesticity in Émile. This man wrote On the Social Contract.

According to its creator, this concept leads to the inevitable misery of sexual love, as it is merely the attempt of this concept to immortalise itself through biological continuation. For 10 points:
Name this concept, a ‘blind and unconscious striving’ which manifests itself in humans as instinctive self-preservation. It is the first of two concepts in the title of a major philosophical work of 1818.
The will was introduced in The World as Will and Representation, the magnum opus of this pessimistic, Eastern-inspired German philosopher who infamously feuded with Hegel.

Answer some questions about classical Indian philosophy, for 10 points each:
Indian philosophy’s approach to this field centers on a set of six pramanas, with different schools of thought defined in part by which ones they accept. This field investigates what knowledge is and how one knows things.
The Vaisheshika relied on the two pramanas of “perception” and “inference” and promoted a type of this position based on the concept of paramāṇu. Leucippus founded the Greek school of thought known by this term.
This thinker argued that language produces the illusion of hierarchical binary opposites 1800 years ahead of Derrida. This founder of the Buddhist Madhyamaka school was a key proponent of the two truths doctrine.

The Africana existentialist Lewis Gordon advocates doing this action to “disciplinarity,” i.e. to philosophy itself, to recover a sense of the fundamental reasons for doing philosophy at all. For 10 points each:
Name this action, whose original formulator contrasts the decisions of Agamemnon, Jephthah, and Brutus with those of a man who did this specific intellectual action and thus got back something “by virtue of the absurd.”
“Is there a Teleological Suspension of the Ethical?” constitutes Problema 1 of this work, which examines Abraham’s sacrifice of Isaac to describe the progression from “infinite resignation” to the “knight of faith.”
Fear and Trembling is a work by this Danish philosopher, the author of Either/Or and The Sickness Unto Death and the dumper of Regine Olsen.

Have you ever thought about yourself? About the fact that you’re thinking about yourself? Fortunately, some philosophers have that brand of navel-gazing covered. For 10 points each:
This German thinker coined the term dasein to refer to the “being-there” that characterises human experiences and the consciousness thereof in his magnum opus Being and Time.
This thinker used the example of the title animal’s conscious experience and the “the subjective character” thereof to criticize reductionism in the article “What Is It Like to Be a Bat?”
A dream of Aristotle telling him to “return to yourself” inspired this thinker to posit the mystical epistemology of “knowledge as presence.” He founded the Illuminationist tradition that produced Mīr Dāmād and Mulla Sadrā.

Karl Popper took the term “open society” from this thinker’s work <em>The</em> <em>Two Sources of Morality and Religion</em>, and this thinker reflected on Einstein’s theory of relativity in <em>Duration and Simultaneity</em>. For 10 points each:
Name this French author of Matter and Memory, who argued that laughter has a primarily moral and social function in essays “on the meaning of the comic” and who formulated the idea of élan vital in Creative Evolution.
Bergson’s doctoral thesis is titled in English for Time and this concept, which Bergson rooted in experiencing “duration.” Galen Strawson’s “basic argument” posits the impossibility of this ability to make meaningful choices.
Central to Bergson’s thought is his privileging of this faculty, which he contrasts with “analysis” and holds to be superior to Kantian rationalism in that it allows one to “enter into” absolute knowledge.

Ned Block argued that functionalism implies that the population of China could form one of these things. Another thought experiment centers on asking if your life is a simulation run on one of these things “in a vat.”
This creator of the “Twin Earth” thought experiment was important in popularizing the “brain in a vat.” He summarized his position of semantic externalism as “meaning just ain’t in the head.”
This position associated with Mark Rowlands, Andy Clark, and David Chalmers holds that cognition itself is not purely in the head but also heavily involves an agent’s environment and its interactions with it.

William of Malmesbury rather spuriously claims that this thinker’s students stabbed him to death with their pens. For 10 points each:
Name this thinker who made a notable translation of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and divides nature into four parts along axes of creating and being created in his pantheistic work Periphyseon.
This later thinker formulated the concept of “univocity of being” and called the property that makes a thing what it is its “haecceity” or “thisness.” This thinker was often known as “Doctor Subtilis.”

Name this mathematician-turned-philosopher who rejected the psychologistic account of mathematics in his Logical Investigations.
Husserl developed phenomenology around this methodological technique, which involves suspending judgment about the contents of the external world and reserving metaphysical assumptions in order to observe consciousness directly.
Husserl’s first book was a treatise on The Philosophy of this subject. Earlier, Frege (FRAY-guh) wrote a book on The Foundations of this subject, which influenced Russell. It involves the elementary mathematics of numbers and the basic operations of addition and subtraction.

Contrary to Jacques Maritain, Umberto Eco argued that this philosopher’s theory of aesthetic perception, or <em>visio</em>, was strongly cognitive rather than intuitive. For 10 points each:
Name this philosopher who described beauty in terms of the three qualities of integritas, consonantia, and claritas.
Although Aquinas was an Aristotelian, his views on divine beauty were influenced by Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite (air-ee-OP-ug-ite), a member of this school of thought whose other members included Porphyry.
The views of Plotinus and other Neoplatonists on beauty were often derived from this Platonic dialogue about love. In this dialogue, Socrates recounts how Diotima taught him about a hierarchy of kinds of love.

Answer the following about the life and work of philosopher Janet Radcliffe Richards, for 10 points each.
In bioethics, Radcliffe Richards defended this practice against accusations that it results from “coercion by poverty” and argued that banning it, as most countries do, produces black markets. Nancy Scheper-Hughes leads an organization against this practice.
Radcliffe Richards first made her reputation with a book written as part of this movement, but from a “skeptical” perspective. Simone de Beauvoir’s The Second Sex was a touchstone for the second wave of this movement.
This longtime partner of Radcliffe Richards imagined being very gradually turned into Greta Garbo to argue for a reductive account of personal identity in Reasons and Persons.

Name this Bulgarian-born French feminist thinker who wrote Powers of Horror and introduced the term “intertextuality.” Allegations made in 2018 suggest that she may have been a Bulgarian secret agent.
Kristeva’s notion of abjection, which describes a visceral reaction to a threatened dissolution of meaning, was inspired by the notion of objet petit a (ob-JAY puh-TEET AH) from the psychoanalytic theories of this author of Écrits (ay-KREE).

Name this “second sage,” an ancient Chinese philosopher who lends his name to the last of the Four Books.
Mencius followed his teacher Zisi (TSUH-suh) in elaborating The Doctrine of this concept, the medium between extremes; Zisi’s (TSUH-suh’s) book with that title is the second of the Four Books. Aristotle developed his ethics around the “virtuous” example of this thing.

Name this practice which Giovanni Pico della Mirandola linked with Kabbalah and advocated as a means to achieve union with God. Pico’s Oration on the Dignity of Man contrasts a beneficial form of this practice with the harmful goetia.
Another major trend in Renaissance humanism was the revival of Epicureanism, spurred in part by Poggio Bracciolini’s rediscovery of this Roman philosopher’s poem On the Nature of Things.
This philosopher rejected the use of magic because of its emphasis on individual skill and individual gains. He dismissed four “idols” and promoted empirical science in his Novum Organum.

Ghiselin and Hull have argued that biological species are individuals rather than these things. For 10 points each:
Name these kinds of groupings that reflect the structure of the world outside the human mind. Their name was coined in a 1969 paper by Willard van Orman Quine. Philosophers debate whether sets such as “objects that are white” count as this sort of grouping.
John Stuart Mill introduced his earlier notion of “kinds” as an aid in this type of reasoning. Nelson Goodman’s grue paradox was a “new riddle” of this kind of reasoning.
Although Quine agreed to the inductive value of natural kinds, he denied that they have essences and rejected this Greek philosopher’s distinction between essence and accident, as expressed in his Metaphysics.

Gilles Deleuze (ZHEEL duh-LOOZ) quotes Spinoza’s statement that we do not know the limits of what these things are capable of under laws of nature in an essay that asks, “What can” these things “do?” For 10 points each:
Name this sort of physical thing. Deleuze also borrowed from Antonin Artaud in theorizing a kind of them “without organs.”
Deleuze noted the roles of Spinoza and this idealist philosopher in the backlash against Descartes’s mind-body dualism, which rendered matter inert. This man argued for pre-established harmony and wrote Monadology.
Deleuze first discussed the body without organs in a chapter from The Logic of Sense titled for someone with this mental disorder, who probes “depths,” in contrast to the “Little Girl.” Deleuze and Guattari wrote a two-volume work about Capitalism and this disorder.

The “negatively rational” process by which the second of these concepts overtakes the first is described with the term <em>aufhebung</em> (OWF-hay-boong), or “sublation.” For 10 points each:
Identify this opposing pair of terms that often describes the first two stages of G. W. F. Hegel’s (HAY-gull’s) dialectic. This pair of terms was actually first used by Johann Fichte (FICK-tuh), who described their union as a “synthesis.”
Hegel’s dialectic built upon the four antinomies identified in this book, which Hegel critiqued for its refusal to see those contradictions as inherent to the world itself. This book uses a number of transcendental arguments to counter empiricist skepticism.
In Soren Kierkegaard’s Either/Or, this character uses Hegel’s term aufhebung to describe the effect of marriage on romantic passion. Victor Eremita discovers a bunch of letters this man sent to the seducer “A” to persuade him of the value of the ethical stage.

Name this function that a philosopher used in an example of another philosopher’s rule-following paradox. In that example, this function is confused with addition when someone is asked to add 68 to 57.
This philosopher used the quus function in an example of the rule-following paradox in his reading of Philosophical Investigations. This American philosopher introduced the term “rigid designator” in his book Naming and Necessity.

Name this school based on the teachings of Aristotle, legendarily named for his habit of lecturing while walking the building’s colonnades.
Theophrastus introduced the “prosleptic” form of these arguments. As defined by Aristotle, they consist of a major and minor premise and take the form “All cats are dogs. Garfield is a cat. Therefore, Garfield is a dog.”
Theophrastus also wrote on the “art” of this skill. Aristotle’s own treatise on it defines logos, ethos, and pathos, while Cicero wrote about it in De oratore.

Nietzsche explained ressentiment in this text, which compares guilt to a creditor–debtor relationship and rejects “slave morality.” This text built on concepts sketched out in Beyond Good and Evil.
Nietzsche attributes slave morality’s triumph through ressentiment to these people, who bridged their slave morality into Christianity. These people were enslaved after the destruction of their Second Temple in Jerusalem.

Name this view that holds that the semantic contribution of a name is only its referent. This view was detailed in its namesake’s 1843 work A System of Logic, which distinguished between denotation and connotation.
Saul Kripke’s causal theory of reference claims that a name’s referent is initially fixed by this action, which he alternatively terms an “initial baptism.”
This philosopher argued that names were disguised definite descriptions and analyzed the sentence “the present King of France is not bald” in his essay “On Denoting.”

Name this former professor at Rutgers University who argued that cognition takes place in a “language of thought.” He supports a version of the computational theory of mind, or CTM.
One attack against CTM utilizes this mathematical theorem, as CTM requires the mind to be a consistent formal system. Roger Penrose and J.R. Lucas have both used this argument, although it is not widely supported.
Some philosophers argue that CTM implies the nonexistence of this concept. This concept is often contrasted with determinism, while compatibilism says that the two can co-exist.

Identify this principle that a Pre-Socratic philosopher believed started the rotation of the universe and mixes all substances so that “everything is in everything.” Either the Greek term or its English translations are acceptable.
Anaxagoras, the theorizer of nous, is ridiculed for believing that food contains bits of blood and bone in this Roman thinker’s didactic poem On the Nature of Things, which also discusses the swerving of atoms.
In this dialogue, Socrates points out that his accuser Meletus has wrongly attributed Anaxagoras’s theory, that the Sun is a fiery stone, to him. This dialogue centers on a speech given by Socrates at his trial for impiety.

Name this concept, the title subject of a discourse by Jean-Jacques Rousseau that calls the first man to have enclosed a piece of land and declared “this is mine!” the founder of civil society.
Rousseau’s Discourse on Inequality was wrongly accused of promoting the “noble savage” due to its discussion of this condition that humans existed in before society formed. Hobbes called life in this state “a war of all against all” and “nasty, brutish, and short.”
Discourse on Inequality contrasts a form of this concept that causes primitive man to preserve his own well-being with a more harmful type in which people are aware of how others perceive them.

G. E. M. Anscombe used this approach to ethics to protest the nuclear bombing of Japan in her essay “Mr. Truman’s Degree.” For 10 points each:
Name this approach to ethics that contrasts with consequentialism by holding that we act morally when we act according to certain moral duties.
This German thinker’s deontological moral theory states that we should only carry out actions that we’d will to be universal law, an idea known as the categorical imperative.

Answer some questions about the intellectual movement known as transhumanism, which advocates the research and development of human-enhancing technologies. For 10 points each:
As part of a special report for Foreign Policy, this political theorist denounced transhumanism as “the world’s most dangerous idea.” He claimed that liberal democracy had triumphed in The End of History and the Last Man.
This word names an important theoretical event in transhumanism, during which an artificial intelligence’s self-improvement leads to an “intelligence explosion.” This word also names the point at the center of a black hole.

One solution to the problem of this thing is panpsychism, which holds that all matter has mental properties. For 10 points each:
Philosophers of mind discuss the “hard problem” of this concept, defined as the state of being aware. Qualia are the subjective aspects of this type of experience.
Thomas Nagel’s argument for panpsychism is partly based on the idea that mental states cannot be reduced to physical states, which he’d earlier argued for in this 1974 paper that uses the experiences of the title animal as an example.
This philosopher expressed sympathy for panpsychism in the section “What is it like to be a thermostat?” of his best-known book, which also uses the conceivability of p-zombies to argue that consciousness is nonphysical.

Answer the following about discussions of “home” and “dwelling” in Continental philosophy, for 10 points each.
In “Building, Dwelling, Thinking,” Martin Heidegger revisited the term “dwelling,” which he’d used to describe this concept’s interaction with the world. In Being and Time, this German word denotes an entity concerned with its own being.
In a book about the “Poetics” of this concept, Gaston Bachelard (“bosh-LARR”) discussed the home as a shelter for dreaming. Henri Lefebvre (“luh-FEV”) wrote about the production of the social form of this concept.
Emmanuel Levinas, a philosopher who practiced this religion, defined “dwelling” as “a retreat home with oneself.” Moses Maimonides wrote about this religion and philosophy in The Guide for the Perplexed.

In Book XI of his Confessions, Augustine gets utterly flummoxed in attempts to define this concept, though he is sure God exists beyond it. For 10 points each:
Name this concept which allows humans to order events in sequence and measure how long they take. The grandfather paradox could result from free travel of a person within it.
J.M.E. McTaggart came to this conclusion about time after arguing that it makes no sense to mark events by tense in relation to the present via an "A-series" or to objectively order them in a "B-series." 
This section of Kant's Critique of Pure Reason defines time as a "form of pure intuition" corresponding to "inner sense," as space does to "outer sense." In both major editions, it's the first section after the Preface.

Answer the following about types of non-standard philosophical logic which do wacky things with truth values, for 10 points each.
This ancient school developed a form of logic based on propositions rather than terms, letting them derive more complex truth-functions than Aristotle. Zeno of Citium founded this school, which opposed the Epicureans.
Logicians using this non-Western language had the catuskoti, or four truth values, including "both true and false." Writings in this language discuss a form of reason called nyaya and an inherent emptiness called sunyata.
This type of logic, based on the work of Jan Łukasiewicz and Lofti Zadeh, assigns propositions a truth value between 0 and 1 to represent degrees of truth. In philosophy, it is useful for analyzing problems of vagueness.

Give the real name of this Danish philosopher, who used the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio while analyzing Abraham's sacrifice of Isaac in Fear and Trembling.
Problema I of Fear and Trembling asks this question, which roughly means: Can an individual ever stand above universal rules of proper conduct, ignoring them to fulfill a specific end goal given directly by God?
Fear and Trembling then asks if we have this sort of duty to God. Hegel scholars often modify his idealism with this adjective, which British Idealist F.H. Bradley used as a noun to denote the first principle of existence

Answer the following about Proclus, perhaps the pre-eminent philosopher of the 5th century CE, for 10 points each.
] Like earlier Neoplatonists, Proclus believed that this entity was the ultimate principle of reality, and put other things like nous and logos in a hierarchy of "emanations" from it. It's roughly the same as Plato's Form of the Good.
Proclus's commentary on this Plato dialogue expounds at length on its images of the "World Soul" and a creator called the "Demiurge." Its account of the lost city Atlantis is continued in the Critias.

Name this branch of philosophy concerned with the nature of art and beauty.
Ngai's categories add to this book's tetrad of the agreeable, good, beautiful, and sublime. It discusses a process by which a particular, like an artwork, is "subsumed under" a universal in sections on aesthetics and teleology. 
Sianne Ngai's work assumes that we live in this economic stage not predicted by classical Marxism, with a 2-word name. Fredric Jameson assessed the commodified "cultural logic of" this stage in his book Postmodernism.

Frege's work on logic moved beyond these basic three-part arguments, in which a major premise and a minor premise lead to a deductive conclusion. They were the basis of Aristotle's logic and of most Western logic instruction for 2300 years thereafter.
Instead, Frege's logic largely uses these properties, which can be evaluated as true or false when applied to a variable. The idea of "is tall" in the sentence "John is tall" is one of these, which are usually symbolized by a capital letter preceding a variable in parentheses.

Answer the following about 20th century philosopher Carl Hempel, for 10 points each.
Carl Hempel developed a "deductive-nomological" model of this branch of academic inquiry. Thomas Kuhn described "revolutions" in this type of inquiry as "paradigm shifts" in which a new set of ideas is incommensurable with the old.
Carl Hempel challenged the validitiy of this form of reasoning by developing the "ravens paradox," according to which observing any non-black non-raven lets you conclude that all ravens are black. This type of reasoning looks towards regular past examples to make assumptions about the future.

This thought experiment considers the imaginary liquid XYZ.
Name this thought experiment devised by Hilary Putnam which posits a man on Earth named Oscar and his duplicate on another planet. Putnam argued that the liquid XYZ could not justifiably be called "water."
The Twin Earth experiment explores this concept, which Putnam claimed "ain't just in the head." Semantics is the study of this thing, and the words "denotation" and "connotation" reflect two different aspects of this concept for a word.
Putnam's idea that "meanings just ain't in the head" is an example of this philosophical viewpoint, which holds that factors beyond the mind partly determine meaning.

The "legal" form of this theory argues that laws are a set of conventions or social norms whose validity does not necessarily rest on the specific merits of the law. 
Give this word, that also refers to a philosophical movement started by Auguste Comte, who held that sensory experience is the only reliable source of information.
Some of the first strains of legal positivism are attributable to this English philosopher. His "greatest happiness principle" was an important cornerstone of his utilitarian thought and that of his student John Stuart Mill.
This major contrasting view to positivism claims that the law's authority is derived from the extent of its moral merit. John Finnis and L. Lon Fuller are major proponents of this position.

Name this branch of philosophy concerned with art and beauty.
In the 18th century, the aesthetic "quarrel" named for these two groups was the subject of much debate in the French Academy. The quarrel basically asks whether antiquated or progressive notions of beauty are more correct.
Immanuel Kant also wrote a work that distinguishes the enjoyment derived from beauty with the enjoyment derived from this other feeling, which is a mixture of awe and horror. Looking at a waterfall, or the night sky induces this feeling, according to Kant.

Answer some questions about Kantian epistemology as expressed in The Critique of Pure Reason. For 10 points each:
Kant believed that human reason enabled our minds to structure this concept, and he called metaphysics "the cognitions after which reason might strive independently of all" this. Empiricists believe that knowledge comes from this.
Two answers required. According to Kant's scheme of classifying propositions in The Critique of Pure Reason, these two terms describe the lone type of proposition that is self-contradictory and therefore cannot exist.
This argument from the Critique asserts that without the a priori concepts of space and time, which Kant called "categories," we cannot lay the foundation for understanding our unified field of experience.
