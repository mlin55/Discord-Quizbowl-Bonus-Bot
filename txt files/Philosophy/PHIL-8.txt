This book traces a shift from practitioners asking “What's the matter with you?” in the 18th century to asking “Where does it hurt?” in the 19th. For 10 points each:
Name this 1963 book that discusses how scholars like Marie-Francois Bichat [bee-SHAH] began seeing bodies as clusters of symptoms. Its introduction oh-so-humbly calls it “a book about space, about language, about death.”
This bald French post-structuralist discussed how patients are subjected to the “medical gaze” in The Birth of the Clinic. He also wrote Discipline and Punish.
Foucault was influenced by this earlier French doctor and social theorist, who analyzed 19th-century conceptions of “biology” and “disease” in The Normal and the Pathological.

Mikhail Bakhtin introduced the terms “heteroglossia” and “chronotope” in a collection of essays named for this kind of <em>Imagination</em>. For 10 points each:
Name this concept that Bakhtin contrasted with dialectics. This term also denotes the main philosophical form used by Plato.
This twentieth-century German philosopher developed a “philosophy of dialogue,” which theorizes relational and objectifying modes of encounter named for the two word-pairs “I-You” and “I-It.”
This other philosopher argued that Buber’s model of dialogue mistakenly envisions the I-You as reciprocal and not asymmetrical, and fails to account for the third-person “illeity” necessary to the structure.

Shortly after MIT philosopher George Boolos died, many of his essays were collected in the anthology <em>Logic, Logic, and Logic.</em> For 10 points each:
Many essays in Logic, Logic, and Logic are about this German logician. This author of the Begriffschrift analyzed two forms of meaning in the sentence “Hesperus is Phosphorus” in the essay “Sense and Reference.”
A Boolos essay on this kind of logic defends it from Quine’s claim that it’s merely a form of set theory. By Frege’s Theorem, Hume’s principle is enough to derive all of Peano arithmetic within this form of logic.
A trollish essay near the end of Logic, Logic, and Logic purports to prove this mathematical result using only words of one syllable in length. The Lucas–Penrose argument attempts to conclude from this result that minds are not entirely mechanistic.

In <em>Allegories of Reading</em>, Paul de Man calls Nietzsche and this man “Archie De-Bunkers” who are unafraid to ask, “What’s the difference?”. For 10 points each:
Name this French post-structuralist who attacked the logocentric “metaphysics of presence” using his trademark method of deconstruction in books like Of Grammatology.
Derrida entered into an unlikely debate with this philosopher after he accused Derrida’s essay “Signature Event Context” of misrepresenting J.L. Austin’s theories. Derrida replied to this author with the mocking book Limited Inc.
This Harvard sociologist attempted to explain the tenor and cause of Derrida’s reception in America in the essay “How to Become a Dominant French Philosopher.” This pioneer of boundary-work employed that methodology in The Dignity of Working-Men.

This philosopher argued that if Hobbes himself were as selfish as he claims people are in general, then he wouldn’t have tried to better humanity by writing <em>Leviathan</em>. For 10 points each:
Name this English philosopher who described people’s attitudes toward their own affections as a “moral sense” identical to the sense of beauty in his Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times.
In the third dialogue of this philosopher’s Alciphron, the character Euphranor rebuts the realist aesthetic views of Shaftesbury and Francis Hutcheson by showing that the beauty of a chair or a door is dependent on its function. This British empiricist also wrote Three Dialogues between Hylas and Philonous.
In an Allan Ramsay dialogue on this faculty, Colonel Freeman claims that only by convention would a Corinthian capital by less beautiful upside-down. A David Hume essay identifies the “standard” of this faculty of aesthetic judgment as the “joint verdict” of “true critics.”

This work attacks positions it dubs “ersatzist” in the chapter “Paradise on the Cheap?” For 10 points each:
Name this modal realist work, which argues that the title entities exist in the ordinary language sense, are causally isolated from each other, and can thus each be properly considered “actual” relative to the people in them.
In On the Plurality of Worlds, David Lewis also advances counterpart theory as an alternative to the modal semantics developed by this philosopher. This philosopher argued that names are “rigid designators” in Naming and Necessity.
On the Plurality of Worlds also introduced these two terms for positions in philosophy of identity. One holds objects to be wholly present at any time, and the other that objects are “extended” across temporal parts. Give either.

This thinker wrote that “nature is Messianic by reason of its eternal and total passing away” in a puzzling “Theological-Political Fragment.” For 10 points each:
Name this German philosopher who described “the messianic” as a “weak power” and formulated the notion of “messianic time.”
Benjamin is best-known for an essay analyzing how the “aura” around these things has changed “in the Era of Mechanical Reproduction,” which subverts the danger of the aestheticization of politics. Richard Wagner advocated a “total” form of these things encompassing as many forms as possible.
This contemporary philosopher argued that Benjamin’s “messianic time” was a reprise of Pauline theology in his book The Time That Remains. His most famous work includes the volume Remnants of Auschwitz.

Nancy Cartwright rejects Carl Hempel’s covering-law account of <em>these</em> entities on the grounds that it relies on implausible <em>ceteris paribus</em> constraints. For 10 points each:
Identify these things that “lie” according to the title of one of Cartwright’s books. That book favors a simulacrum account of explanation.
Cartwright’s claim that causal explanations, but not theoretical explanations, have “truth built into them” is a partial version of this thesis that our best theories describe entities that actually exist in the world. Hilary Putnam’s “no miracles” argument supports it.
Duke philosopher Alex Rosenberg has assessed the status of laws in this social science discipline. Milton Friedman argued that theories in the “positive” form of this discipline should be judged by the accuracy of their predictions rather than their assumptions.

For 10 points each—answer the following about medieval theories of language:
A medieval philosopher with this surname expanded on Augustine’s theory of linguistic signs as triadic relations in his work De signis. A later philosopher with this surname advocated the scientific method in his Novum Organum.
Roger Bacon’s idea that a common grammar underlies all languages influenced this school of philosophers across northern Europe, whose most famous member was Thomas of Erfurt. These philosophers emphasized that signification relies on understanding, which itself is grounded in the external world.
Thomas of Erfurt is suspected to have studied in the arts faculty at this university, where St. Thomas Aquinas studied under Albertus Magnus. John Buridan was a lifelong arts master at this university.

Postmodern philosophy’s use of this word’s adjectival form is prefigured by Walter Benjamin’s reference to this sort of “messianic power.” For 10 points each:
Identify this attribute that names a type of theology introduced by John Caputo that focused on God’s instability and a type of “thought” advocated by Gianni Vattimo that avoids the claims to certainty made in metaphysics.
Caputo wrote about this thinker’s “religion without religion” in a book titled for his “prayers and tears.” Caputo’s book about postmodernism and the church, What Would Jesus Deconstruct?, is titled for a method this French thinker advanced in Of Grammatology.
The phrase “weak messianic power” appears in this Benjamin essay, which compares materialist perspectives on the title subject to the mechanical Turk and imagines an angel with his “face turned towards the past.”

In response to John Norris and Mary Astell, a thinker with this maiden name argued that God is the sole proper object of our love in <em>A Discourse Concerning the Love of God</em>. For 10 points each:
Give this maiden name of the philosopher Damaris Masham. Masham corresponded with Leibniz about the philosophy of her father, had this surname and wrote works rebutting “hylozoic” atheism.
Masham’s Occasional Thoughts argues for this opportunity for women, which was also advocated by Mary Astell. Rousseau argued that women should receive this right to be more pleasing to men in his treatise on it, Emile.
Masham’s father, Ralph Cudworth, was a member of this philosophical movement. Anne Conway, whose vitalism influenced Leibniz’s idea of monads, was associated with this movement.

The presence of this condition at the conclusion typically distinguishes early Platonic dialogues from middle and late dialogues. For 10 points each:
Give this Greek term for the state of puzzlement frequently arrived at by Socrates and his interlocutors in the early dialogues.
In this non-aporetic middle dialogue by Plato, the immortality of the soul is discussed within Socrates’s jail cell. At the end of this dialogue, Socrates asks Crito to sacrifice a cock to Asclepius after taking the hemlock.
This early Platonic dialogue on the nature of beauty introduces the Platonic idea of “that which is good in and of itself.” Its main interlocutor defines beauty first as “a pretty girl,” and then as “gold,” and then as being “rich and respected.”

A philosopher of this religion applied a doctrine typically translated as “dependent origination” to analyzing a chain of twelve causes. For 10 points each:
Name this religion. A proposition can be both true and false or neither true nor false in the “tetralemma,” or Catuṣkoṭi form of argumentation used by Nagarjuna, a sage of this religion’s Mahayana branch.
The namesake of this Greek school of thought expounded a doctrine almost identical to Nagarjuna’s method of fourfold negation, which he likely encountered in India. Adrian Kuzminski’s book titled for this school examines “How the Ancient Greeks Reinvented Buddhism,” and it titles the major work of Sextus Empiricus.
This school of Hindu philosophy, a frequent target of Nagarjuna’s writing, instead used a two-valued logic system in its writings. This school prefigured contemporary reliabilism by accepting four knowledge-sources, or pramanas, as legitimate ways of gaining knowledge.

While in Athens, this thinker produced the first Latin translations of Pseudo-Dionysius. For 10 points each:
Name this 9th-century Irish philosopher who defined god as universitas rerum, or the totality of things, in his magnum opus Periphyseon, or On the Division of Things.
Eriugena was heavily inspired by this philosophical tradition, which began with Plotinus and held that reality was the emanation of a single principle called “the One.”
Eriugena’s translations helped revive Neoplatonic thought several hundred years after this historical event, which scholars typically use to mark the end of Neoplatonism. Following this event, Damascius and his followers fled to the court of Khosrau.

One version of this argument compares a heated poker and the Greenwich meridian to argue that its target cannot account for change. For 10 points each:
Identify this argument advanced by J. M. E. McTaggart, which holds that the B-series account of its subject is inadequate and that the A-series view leads to an infinite regress.
This student of McTaggart argued that the regress in the argument is based on a misleading replacement of copulas. This openly-gay philosopher proposed what is now called the “growing block” theory of time and advocated emergentism in The Mind and Its Place in Nature.
Like his teacher F. H. Bradley, McTaggart was part of this British branch of this movement, which Russell developed analytic philosophy in reaction to. Kant developed a “transcendental” form of this position, which broadly holds that reality is created by thought.

Functionalist attempts to preserve this belief system despite its “explanatory impotence” are analogized to alchemy in a paper that treats it “as a theory.” For 10 points each:
Give this two-word term for the belief system whose existence and use as a theory for tasks like “mindreading” is posited by the “theory-theory.” Jerry Fodor has argued that a mature science will vindicate the core tenets of this theory.
The aforementioned Paul Churchland paper is titled for “eliminative materialism and” these mental states posited by folk psychology. The content of these mental states are expressed with “that-clauses,” such as “John believes that snow is white.”
Fodor has defended folk psychological explanations of behavior as deriving from the input of desire and this concept. Edmund Gettier challenged the conception of knowledge as “justified true” instances of this state of mind.

The Walloon Consistory objected to this thinker’s portrayal of a biblical king’s amorality in the “David” section of his best-known book. For 10 points each:
Name this French philosopher who buried his controversial ideas on topics such as religious toleration in the lengthy footnotes to his magnum opus, a “historical and critical” reference book that greatly influenced the Enlightenment.
That “historical and critical” work by Bayle was a text of this sort. It is considered a precursor of a later text of this sort compiled by Jean d’Alembert and Denis Diderot.
The Walloon Church’s targeting of Bayle compelled him to publish a set of pieces of this title on his views on Manicheism and skepticism. Nicolas Malebranche defended his theory of “vision in God” in the tenth of sixteen pieces of this type he appended to The Search after Truth.

Name this specific subject whose “foundations” title an 1884 treatise that introduced the context principle in its introduction and proved that the Peano axioms can be derived in second-order logic from Hume’s principle.
The Foundations of Arithmetic and The Basic Laws of Arithmetic are key works of logicist philosophy of mathematics by this German thinker, who also wrote “On Sense and Reference.”
Michael Dummett pinpointed paragraph 62 of Frege’s Foundations of Arithmetic as the start of this event, which he identified with the birth of analytic philosophy. This term was popularized by a 1967 Richard Rorty anthology of the same name.

C.B. Martin introduced the idea of “finkish” properties of this type, which are lost when they are tested for. For 10 points each:
Name these properties, which categorical monism holds are actually categorical properties. The brittleness of glass is an example of this sort of property given in The Concept of Mind, which contrasts these properties with “occurrences.”
This philosopher presented the eyebrow-raising argument that the motives of actions are dispositional and shouldn’t be explained with reference to hidden mental processes in his aforementioned book, The Concept of Mind.
The Concept of Mind discusses this type of practical knowledge as a “multi-track” disposition and attacks the “intellectualist legend” that it derives from the type of propositional knowledge with which it is usually contrasted.

The “Meinongian’s” (my-NONG-ee-an's) inability to account for the restriction of the “range of quantification” on statements about this domain is addressed in a David Lewis paper titled for “truth in” this topic. For 10 points each:
Name this subject whose relation to philosophy is the subject of the book Love’s Knowledge. That book, which contains the essays “Flawed Crystals” and “Finely Aware and Richly Responsible,” holds that this subject can constitute a kind of moral philosophy and that it represents a “paradigm of moral activity.”
Those views on the alliance of fiction and ethical theory are a signature position of this University of Chicago philosopher, whose reading of Plato’s Symposium is presented in The Fragility of Goodness.
In “Truth in Fiction,” David Lewis applied his theory of these entities to analyzing statements like “Holmes lived at 221B Baker Street.” In modal logic, a necessary fact is true in all of these entities, and Leibniz claimed we lived in the best of all of them.

The first comprehensive treatment of this idea is found in a “manual” by Nicomachus of Gerasa. For 10 points each:
Name this idea related to the order of the universe that is also discussed in Cicero’s Dream of Scipio, in which Scipio Africanus explains this concept that his grandson perceives as “tantus et tam dulcis.”
The first section of this late antiquity thinker’s De institutione musica discusses the music of the spheres, which is greater than the music of spiritual harmony and instrumental music produced by humans. He was executed shortly after completing a work framed around the fickleness of fortune.
The concept of the music of the spheres is credited to this mystic, who banned his followers from eating beans, taught the transmigration of souls, and is credited with devising a fundamental geometrical theorem.

A chapter on this concept and freedom claims that, “from the very beginning, existentialism defined itself as a philosophy of” this concept. For 10 points each:
Name this concept, the “ethics” of which titles a 1947 book that works out a moral system based on Jean-Paul Sartre’s Being and Nothingness.
The Ethics of Ambiguity is a work by this existentialist philosopher, who wrote that “one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman” in her book The Second Sex.
Maurice Merleau-Ponty held that the “ambiguity of being-in-the-world is translated by that of” this entity in his book The Phenomenology of Perception. The “image” of this concept is discussed throughout the book, which argues that this thing is a subject that perceives the world and not a mere object.

A statement about this action was partly rescinded in a passage comparing it to the right “a tortured man has to scream” and raising the broader question of whether “you can go on living.” For 10 points each:
Name this action that a critic called “barbaric” because it represented “absolute reification” presupposing “intellectual progress as one of its elements” in the essay “Cultural Criticism and Society.”
This leading cultural critic of the Frankfurt School discussed his remark that “to write poetry after Auschwitz is barbaric” in Negative Dialectics, published 19 years after his Dialectic of Enlightenment.
This critic wrote Poetry after Auschwitz, a study in which she argued that Adorno’s remark sparked a tradition of writing Holocaust poetry. With Sandra Gilbert, she authored a feminist interpretation of Victorian literature titled The Madwoman in the Attic.

In Edmund Husserl’s phenomenology, “intentional” features of this sort encapsulate anticipated elements of experience, such as the unseen sides of a house. For 10 points each:
Name this type of feature that is used to metaphorically refer to a historically effected interpretative perspective in Hans-Georg Gadamer’s Truth and Method, which describes the gaining of a common understanding as the “fusion” of these features.
The notion of the horizon is central to Gadamer’s account of this field that involves the theory and methodology of interpretation. Friedrich Schleiermacher and Wilhelm Dilthey were 19th-century developers of this field.
In Truth and Method, Gadamer contrasts Erfahrung, a type of ongoing, horizon-widening experience, with the more immediate type of lived experience denoted by this German word, whose history is the subject of a chapter in the book.

To illustrate these constructs, the author applies them to Baron Liebig’s investigations of death by metal poisoning. For 10 points each:
What five tools for identifying causal relationships consist of ones of “agreement,” “difference,” “concomitant variations,” and “residues” and a “joint” one that combines “agreement and difference”?
The “method of agreement” introduced in Mill’s A System of Logic is aimed at showing that a condition has this property, while the “method of difference” is aimed at establishing a “sufficient” condition. A condition that is both this and sufficient creates an if and only if relationship.
A System of Logic lays out Mill’s “direct reference” theory of these terms, which holds that the meaning of one of them is only its referent. Saul Kripke disputed the “descriptivist” theory of these terms, which associates their meaning with a collection of descriptions.

A book by this thinker used a theological form of phenomenology developed in his country to argue that the individual and community come together via the process of “participation.” For 10 points each:
Name this author of a 1969 book variously translated into English as Person and Act or The Acting Person.
John Paul II’s The Acting Person drew from a Polish scholarly tradition of blending phenomenology with the metaphysics of this Italian Church Doctor, a student of Albertus Magnus who distinguished essence and existence in his extensive commentaries on Aristotle.
John Paul II commented on this aspect of the Creation, which, according to Aquinas, is present in humanity’s capacity to know and love the divine. Aquinas also wrote that this concept mentioned in Genesis was partly lost in the fall of man.

A Francis Perkins book treats Gottfried Leibniz’s interest in this country, with which he wanted to establish a “commerce of light.” For 10 points each:
Name this country, whose “natural theology” is the subject of a discourse by Leibniz. Leibniz also corresponded with the Jesuit Joachim Bouvet about hexagrams used for divination in this country.
Part I of Discourse on the Natural Theology of the Chinese ends by arguing that Chinese philosophy contains this Leibnizian doctrine, which holds that mind and body do not interact, but appear to because they have been synchronized by God.
This thinker delivered the 1721 Speech on the Ethics of the Chinese as his farewell address to the University of Halle. This leader of the German Enlightenment is traditionally seen as the link between Leibniz and Kant.

This phrase, which likely found its first use in the work of G. W. F. Hegel, makes up the adverbial part of the Edmund Husserl concept of the “immer schon da.” For 10 points each:
Name this two-word adverbial phrase, popularized by Martin Heidegger and Jacques Derrida, that denotes the ever-present existence of a concept or condition.
Lisa Gitelman’s 2006 book Always Already New traces new media through the development of this system from ARPANET. Sociologists have studied the “social implications” of this system, including the “digital divide.”

Answer the following about the 13th-century scholastic philosopher Henry of Ghent, for 10 points each.
Henry specially privileged theologians in his theory of the “divine” form of this process, which holds that God’s grace is necessary for human knowledge. Book VI of the Republic contains an analogy comparing this phenomenon to truth’s source in the Good.
Henry participated in the commission that enacted the 1277 one of these events at the University of Paris. Stephen Tempier banned the teaching of over 200 theses in that one of these events, which Pierre Duhem credited with ending the chokehold of Aristotle and paving the way for modern science.
In Henry’s philosophy, this concept, called quidditas, is more central than existence. Jean-Paul Sartre claimed that existence precedes this concept, which is the fundamental set of properties or intrinsic nature of an entity.

Laurence Bonjour switched allegiances to this position after introducing an influential argument for its rival. For 10 points each:
Name this view on epistemic justification that a belief is justified by being built on a set of basic beliefs. It is opposed by coherentism, which holds that a belief is justified by being part of a system of mutually-supporting beliefs.
A whacky alternative in the foundationalism/coherentism debate is Peter Klein’s theory that chains of belief can have this property. David Hilbert imagined a hotel with this many rooms in a paradox about sets with this property.
Elements of the two theories were combined into “foundherentism” by this philosopher. She has written against “vulgar Rortyism” and disputes Rorty’s claims to be a pragmatist in Charles Sanders Peirce’s tradition.

John Martin Fischer developed a “semi-” version of this philosophical position. For 10 points each:
Give this term for positions that attempt to reconcile free will and determinism, such as by holding that moral responsibility can exist in a deterministic universe.
John Martin Fischer’s position of semi-compatibilism draws on the account of moral responsibility presented in this 1962 essay, which discusses the “reactive attitudes” that we would have even if convinced of the truth of determinism.
This philosopher revitalized attempts to reconcile determinism and moral responsibility by proposing namesake cases that violate the Principle of Alternate Possibility. The 2016 election revived interest in his book On Bullshit.

The Ethiopian philosopher Zera Yacob is often considered an analog to this European. Rwandan philosopher Alexis Kagame held that this man’s statement “I think, therefore I am” would be incoherent among the Bantu.
Anton Wilhelm Amo, an 18th-century Ghanaian philosopher who began lecturing at this university in 1840, argued, against Descartes, that the mind could not sense material things. Fichte’s alleged atheism got him dismissed from this university, where another philosopher saw the “world spirit” enter its city on horseback in 1806.

Identify this phase of a philosopher’s output that included the Blue and Brown Books, On Certainty, and a work that appears to reject the picture theory in favor of a more fluid view of language.
Against the narrative of the early and later Wittgensteins, Cora Diamond emphasized the continuity in his work in an essay titled for this action. According to Tractatus 6.54, this metaphorical action must be performed by “anyone who understands me” after they recognize the work as nonsensical.

Simplicius argued that the authors of these texts should not fall short of the <em>megalonoia</em>, or greatness of intellect, of their source. For 10 points each:
Name this type of text, the best known of which was authored by Alexander of Aphrodisias. Avicenna claimed to have read a book 40 times without understanding before being helped by al-Farabi’s text of this type.
Simplicius’s commentaries include important transcriptions of older writings, such as this author’s Proem to his On Nature. This Eleatic philosopher makes the “third man argument” in his namesake Socratic dialogue.
Commentators on Aristotle disagree on an enigmatic half-page chapter from De Anima III in which Aristotle speaks of an “active” form of this concept that is “unaffected and unmixed.” Thomas Aquinas’s text “On the Unity of” this concept disputed the interpretation that Averroes advanced.

The debate between these two thinkers on ontology concerned one’s distinction between internal and external questions about existence. For 10 points each:
Name these two philosophers. In an essay, one of them criticized the other’s use of “state descriptions” and drew from that other thinker’s major book to claim that our statements do not “face the tribunal of” a type of “experience not individually but only as a corporate body.”
The book Dear Carnap, Dear Van collects letters that Quine sent Carnap while the latter was working in this city along with other logical empiricist thinkers such as Otto Neurath.
In “Two Dogmas of Empiricism,” Quine takes Carnap to task for Carnap’s reductionist project of translating statements into a language about these things. J. L. Austin criticized A. J. Ayer’s theory of these entities, which are the immediate objects of perception.

A thought experiment that seeks to illustrate this concept asks if you would help a child drowning in a shallow pond. For 10 points each:
Name this concept proposed in W. E. H. Lecky’s History of European Morals, which originally only included the family. A 1981 book titled for this concept tracks our “Moral Progress,” beginning with “The Origins of Altruism.”
Peter Singer’s The Expanding Circle deals with the implications of this field for ethics. The name of this field, which draws from evolutionary psychology to explain human behavior, was coined in a book subtitled The New Synthesis.
Both Lecky and Singer believe that our expanding circles are just beginning to include these beings, whose “liberation” is advocated by Singer.

Name this author of the highly influential Foundations of Arithmetic, who also wrote “On Sense and Reference.”
This British expert on Frege, who developed the Quota Borda voting system, coined the term “logical harmony” to refer to the idea that there are constraints on the rules of inference that can be used in a logical system.
To argue against logical harmony, Arthur Prior introduced this connective, which allows any statement to be deduced from any starting point. That argument was critiqued in a Nuel Belnap paper supplementing this connective with “plonk” and “plink.”

In a book on this concept “and its limits,” Timothy Williamson argued that it cannot be broken down into other concepts. For 10 points each:
Name this concept that is typically broken down into three components by defining it as “justified true belief,” sometimes with a fourth condition added.
Lehrer and Paxson define knowledge as justified true belief, with the extra condition that there must not be any propositions of this type. In Lehrer and Paxson’s example, “Tom Grabit’s mother testifies that Tom’s identical twin brother was in the library” serves as this type of proposition.
Alvin Goldman added a fourth condition based on this concept. According to a theory of reference based on this concept, referents are fixed by a “dubbing” or “initial baptism.”

Name this Canadian philosopher who outlined the need for critical theory to help present alternatives to the status quo through the idea of “reflective disclosure” in his book Critique and Disclosure.
Kompridis’s idea of “reflective disclosure” is a reaction to the work of this philosopher, who proposed a distinction between the “system” and “lifeworld” in a book that discusses “ideal speech situations” in describing how rationality can arise through discourse.
Kompridis contrasts Habermas’s rule-based approach to democratic politics with the possibility of a romantic democratic politics in the tradition of this author of The Human Condition and The Origins of Totalitarianism.

Answer the following about the question of whether or not existence is a predicate, for 10 points each:
Kant rejected this argument for the existence of God by arguing that existence is not a real predicate, and therefore a “supremely perfect being” need not necessarily exist.
In a book of this two-word title, Terence Parsons argued that things like “existence” and “being possible” are extranuclear predicates. Meinong’s jungle is populated by things described by this two-word phrase.
In his book Towards Non-Being, this philosopher adopted Richard Routley’s noneism (“NUN-ism”), the theory that some things do not exist, based on the notion that existence is a predicate. He’s better known for defending dialetheism (“die-uh-LETH-ee-ism”).

In a paper classifying “I” as an “essential indexical,” this philosopher recalled following a trail of sugar on the supermarket floor to try to catch the shopper with the torn bag, only to realize he himself was that shopper. For 10 points each:
Name this philosopher known for his work with Jon Barwise on situation semantics. He won an Ig Nobel prize for his theory of structured procrastination.
Barwise and Perry also discussed the “slingshot argument,” which states that all sentences with this property stand for the same thing. Theories of this property include the correspondence and coherence theories.
This philosopher presented a version of the slingshot argument which states that all true sentences refer to the same Great Fact. His other papers include “A Nice Derangement of Epitaphs,” “Truth and Meaning” and “Actions, Reasons, and Causes.”

In an interview published in 1976 titled “Only a God Can Save Us,” the interviewee defended ideas which he had earlier presented in a speech in this city, in which he claimed to have opposed the “politicizing of science.” For 10 points each:
Name this city, where the “Knowledge Service” was argued to bind “the people to the destiny of the state in a spiritual mission.” The speaker aimed to realize “the primordial and full essence of science,” and argued that “academic freedom” was “not genuine” and “meant… freedom from concern,” and was thus “banished.”
That speech on “The Self-Assertion of the German University” was given by this philosopher, who controversially took up the position of Rector of the University of Freiburg during the Nazi period. He invoked his concept of Dasein (“DAH-zine”) on a number of occasions during the speech.
A German thinker with this surname shaped the idea of the modern research university by founding the University of Berlin, which is today named for him and his brother. He pioneered the idea of academic freedom, while his brother pioneered a new type of Romantic science in works like Kosmos.

Thanks to Porphyry’s Isagoge (“eye-suh-GO-gay”), medieval philosophers adopted a version of Aristotle’s classification of this many predicables (“PRED-icables”), or possible relations between predicates and subjects.
Many Greek texts, including Porphyry’s Isagoge, were read in Latin translations by this medieval philosopher. The title allegorical figure wears a gown with a ladder connecting the letter pi to the letter theta in his Consolation of Philosophy.
This was the only surviving Platonic dialogue throughout most of Middle Ages due to a partial translation by Calcidius. This dialogue describes the orbits of planets and the creation of the “World Soul” by the demiurge.

Name this branch of philosophy that studies the nature of concepts such as art and beauty.
In The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Walter Benjamin (“VALL-tuh BEN-yah-meen”) argues that mechanical reproduction devalues this quality of a work of art, its unique “presence in time and space.”

Answer the following about different philosophical views on logic. For 10 points each:
This German logician developed a formal notation for reasoning in his Begriffsschrift. Sentences in his logical system denote truth values, such that the statement 2 squared = 6 would denote false.
As part of his study of logic, Alfred Tarski developed a theory of the “language of the general theory” of these logical objects. In NGB set theory, the proper version of these objects can be treated explicitly, unlike in ZF set theory.
This thinker’s two “Incompleteness Theorems” are central to formal logic as studied today. His first theorem roughly states that for any consistent formal system F, from which some arithmetic can be carried out, there are statements in the language of F which cannot be proven or disproven.

Schopenhauer’s doctoral thesis was “On the Fourfold Root of” this concept. This concept, which generally states that all actions must have a cause, was formulated along with the principle of contradiction in the Monadology.
This book, Schopenhauer’s magnum opus, includes a refutation of Kant’s idea that sensation is caused by an outside, unknowable object and instead says that only the human body has both of the title concepts.
This other German pessimistic philosopher said that life is absolutely worthless and was inspired by Kant and Schopenhauer to write his Philosophy of Redemption.

Name this philosopher, many of whose works are very literally preserved thanks to Mount Vesuvius's eruption and whose On Nature served as the foundation for Lucretius' poem On the Nature of Things.
Epicurus's physics came from this Greek school of thought that included Leucippus and Democritus. This materialist school claimed all matter was clusters of tiny particles moving through a void.
Unlike Democritus, Lucretius and Epicurus believed atoms possessed weight and could also do this. Atoms' ability to do this explains why bodies larger than single atoms exist and also allows for free will.

Peter Novick wrote a work that studies this concept and the rise and fall of its popularity among American historians.
Name this concept, whose "Question" is the subject of That Noble Dream. E.H. Carr attacked one historian's idea of this concept in chapter one of What is History? by noting that "the historian is necessarily selective."
Carr attacked this 19th century Prussian positivist, who wrote that he sought to represent the past "as it really was" in his History of the Latin and Teutonic Nations. His other works include an attempt at a universal history up to the time of Ancient Greece, and he attacked Hegel for ignoring individual agency.

Name these speech acts that through their utterance cause something to be so. They are opposed to constative acts, which describe things.
The concept of performative utterances is part of the theory of speech acts introduced by this British philosopher in How to Do Things with Words.
The infamous Searle-Derrida debate of the 1970's was set off by this paper, in which Derrida argues that the iterability of communication means that Austin's performative utterances are always prey to infelicity and his concept of intention is never unproblematized. This essay was later reprinted as the first chapter of Limited Inc.

John Etchemendy criticized this man's concept of logical consequence for being over-reliant on the logical connectives of first-order logic.
Name this Polish logician, who also proved the undefinability of models of arithmetic, a result frequently used in proof of GÃ¶del's first incompleteness theorem.
Tarski developed a rigorous semantic theory of this concept in a 1933 paper on it "in formal languages." A sentence like "snow is white" possesses this property if and only if snow is white.
Etchemendy draws attention between the similarities of Tarski's logical consequence and this nineteenth-century mathematician's concept of deducibility, introduced in a less-famous Wissenschaftslehre.

On Russell's side of the divide was this contemporary who disputed the proposition that "esse is pecipi" in his "Refutation of Idealism" and argued that "good" could not be further defined in the Principia Ethica.
Stewart Candlish at the University of Western Australia has argued against the myth, which he claims was perpetuated by Russell, that Bradley was an adherent of this theory of truth. Adherents of this theory of truth hold that the truth of a proposition is dependent on how well it meshes with other propositions.

For 10 points each:
Identify this two-volume work of moral philosophy by Derek Parfit.
Parfit is a notable adherent of this view, according to which statements of moral obligations are statements of fact akin to a report of natural facts. A stronger version of this thesis holds that moral entities objectively exist.
 Parfit's "triple theory" is an attempt to combine consequentialism and contractualism with the philosophy of this deontologist, whose categorical imperative advocates treating people as ends rather than means.

Name these objects useful for determining the logical connection between two statements. Wittgenstein is often credited with their creation in his Tractatus.
This is the name for logics of higher order than propositional logic. In this type of logic, formulae take the form of a function of one or more variables which may be quantified. The functions may then be true for some arguments and false for others.
In first order logic, this process is the removal of all existential quantifiers to make a statement into the namesake normal form. The resulting statement may not be logically equivalent to the original, but it will be equisatisfiable with it.
