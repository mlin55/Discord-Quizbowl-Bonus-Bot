This book contains a thought experiment centering on a Day Man and a Night Man, who, despite sharing the same body, have different memories. For 10 points each:
Name this book whose author illustrated his memory-based account of personal identity in another thought experiment that imagines a cobbler switching bodies with a prince.
Thomas Reid proposed a thought experiment concerning a “brave officer” in response to the memory-based account of personal identity found in this empiricist’s book An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.
This thinker interpreted Locke as arguing that distinct consciousnesses correspond to different modes, rather than different substances, in her Defence of Mr. Locke’s An Essay Concerning Human Understanding.

This paper cites the case <em>Regina v. Finney</em>, in which a defendant who was accused of scalding an inmate in an insane asylum to death had successfully argued that he wasn’t guilty of manslaughter. For 10 points each:
Name this J. L. Austin paper that begins by distinguishing the title phenomenon from justifications. A footnote in it considers the difference between killing a donkey “by mistake” and “by accident.”
J. L. Austin influenced H. L. A. Hart with whom he co-taught a seminar on responsibility. Hart’s book The Concept of the Law defended this approach to jurisprudence that identifies legal facts with social facts.
John Austin, who is not related to J. L. Austin, proposed this proto-legal positivist theory of the law. Hart’s The Concept of the Law begins by criticizing it, arguing that it makes the law no different from a gunman’s threats.

The “world” type of this concept realizes itself through “world-historical figures” like Napoleon. For 10 points each:
Identify this central concept in the philosophy of Hegel (“HAY-gull”), who wrote a book about its “phenomenology.”
Spirit arises from this process wherein the thesis and antithesis interact, driving a dialectical process whose end result is an all-inclusive category called “the Absolute.”
This philosopher offered a semantic reading of Hegel’s Phenomenology of Spirit, interpreting spirit as an inferentialist semantics in his long-awaited 2019 book A Spirit of Trust.

In one paper, this thinker argued that it is incorrect to attribute the belief that a squirrel is up a tree to Norman Malcolm’s barking dog because the dog lacks propositional attitudes. For 10 points each:
Name this philosopher who wrote that paper, “Thought and Talk.” He argued that since animals lack language, they cannot “triangulate” their beliefs with others in his paper “Rational Animals.”
This book expresses skepticism of animal cognition, claiming, “If a lion could talk, we would not understand him.” Norman Malcolm was an expert on this book that defends a use-based theory of meaning.
This philosopher argued that since animals cannot speak, something that most “stupid” and “insane” humans can do, then animals must not have minds in his Discourse on Method.

Wesley Hohfeld developed a logical analysis of these things, distinguishing between the De Morgan dual “liberty” and “claim” types of them. For 10 points each:
Identify these fundamental principles that grant individuals freedoms like freedom of expression. Robert Nozick’s Anarchy, State, and Utopia argues that they impose “side-constraints” on others’ actions.
This philosopher defended the view that rights are “trumps” in his book Taking Rights Seriously. He wrote another work framed as a debate between Judge Hermes and Judge Hercules.
Jeremy Waldron wrote a history of rights theory titled for this three-word phrase, which Jeremy Bentham famously used to dismiss natural rights as nothing more than rhetoric.

This thinker rejected the premise that an omnipotent being can actualize every possible world, a mistake he dubbed “Leibniz’s Lapse.” For 10 points each:
Name this thinker who responded to J. L. Mackie’s logical problem of evil in his “free-will defense,” which claims that God cannot actualize a world wholly without wrong because individuals may be “transworld depraved.”
Plantinga’s God, Freedom, and Evil led to a resurgence in this philosophical view, named for a Spanish Jesuit, which holds that God possesses “middle knowledge,” allowing Him to know all true counterfactuals.
Molinist middle knowledge is a way to avoid the problem of divine foreknowledge, which arises because free will is incompatible with this attribute of God. A being with this property is all-knowing.

Name this paradox that is often illustrated by someone removing grains one by one from a heap and asking when it ceases to be a heap.
This philosopher used the sorites paradox to argue for the title conclusion in his paper “There Are No Ordinary Things.” This famously contrarian philosopher wrote Ignorance: A Case for Scepticism.
In the sorites paradox, predicates have this property, meaning that they admit borderline cases. A notion of “supertruth” is employed by supervaluationists to model this property without moving to non-classical logic.

The thinker who coined the name of this fallacy argued that if it were true, it would render the open-question “Is it true that X is good?” meaningless. For 10 points each:
Name this fallacy that G. E. Moore attacked in Principia Ethica, arguing that goodness cannot be analyzed reductively in terms of properties like desirability or pleasantness.
J. L. Mackie gave this argument against ethical naturalism, claiming that naturalism would require us to posit “qualities or relations of a strange sort, utterly different from anything else in the universe.”
This Philippa Foot book presents a neo-Aristotelian defense of naturalism, arguing that since all organisms have the same “conceptual structure,” the good is the same when evaluating a tree’s roots or a human’s character.

In this dialogue, Socrates cites jurymen who are persuaded by a skilled lawyer as an example of individuals who have a justified true belief “without an account.” For 10 points each:
Name this dialogue in which Socrates calls himself the “midwife to ideas,” asking the title, talented young geometer for the definition of knowledge.
After distinguishing between “having” and “possessing” knowledge, Socrates likens the mind to this kind of object containing knowledge. Theaetetus objects that it would also have to contain pieces of ignorance.
A different account of knowledge from the Theaetetus likens knowledge to a tablet made from this substance. Descartes used the melting of this substance to illustrate how knowledge of the world can be “clear and distinct.”

Robert Stalnaker gave a semantics for the conditional in terms of a selection function that picks out the closest one of these things that makes the antecedent true. For 10 points each:
Name these things. A young Saul Kripke devised a semantics for modal logics based on a frame consisting of a set of these things and an accessibility relation.
Johan van Benthem proved that propositional modal logic is the fragment of this logic that is invariant under bisimulation. Unlike propositional logic, this logic contains quantifiers and variables.
In modal predicate logic, this formula is equivalent to its converse on symmetric frames. This formula says that if everything is necessarily F, then it is necessary that everything is F.

Name this problem that arises because, for any population, there’s a larger population whose total existence is better even though its members have lives not worth living.
Derek Parfit’s repugnant conclusion is a counterexample to this ethical view developed by Jeremy Bentham, which is often divided into “act” and “rule” forms.
This economist-turned-utilitarian-ethicist defended the “intrapersonal addition theorem,” which states that general utility is the sum of individual utilities, in his 1991 book Weighing Goods.

Susan Wolf maintains that sanity is an instance of this two-word phenomenon coined by Bernard Williams in which agents are assigned blame or praise based on factors outside their control.
This philosopher defended a “deep-self” view according to which an agent is responsible if and only if she has a second-order volition for her first-order desire to be effective. His namesake “cases” are counterexamples to the “principal of alternative possibilities.”

This philosopher argued that quantifying over names and descriptions in opaque contexts requires both “notional” and “relational” quantifiers in his paper “Quantifying In.” For 10 points each:
Name this philosopher whose best-known paper identifies a proposition’s meaning with its “character,” a function that maps a proposition to a “content,” which is itself a function from worlds to truth-values.
In that 1989 article, Kaplan used the distinction between “content” and “character” to give a two-dimensional semantics for these context-sensitive expressions exemplified by “here” and “you.”
Kaplan argued that indexicals, like names, are these terms in his paper “Dthat” (“D-that”). Saul Kripke coined the two-word name for these terms, which refer to the same object in every possible world.

Phillippa Foot argued that morality rests not on this concept, but on a related “hypothetical” concept that only applies to individuals who desire to attain certain ends. For 10 points each:
Name this ethical principle central to Kantian ethics that, in one form, states that one should act only according to maxims that can be made universal law.
Besides that version stated in terms of universalizability, Kant gave this other version of the categorical imperative, which states that agents should always treat others as ends in themselves.
This Harvard neo-Kantian called the arguments in her best-known book a “fancy new model” of the formula of humanity. That book argues that moral obligations arise from what she dubbed “practical identities.”

A feminist critique of this concept argues that the requirement of “internal liberalism” gives this concept a much smaller scope than generally thought. For 10 points each:
Name this concept. Liberal defenders of this concept such as Will Kymlicka often ground their support on a theory of “group rights,” while postcolonial defenders reject the universality of liberal norms.
This philosopher wrote the aforementioned “Is Multiculturalism Bad For Women?” She is best-known for articulating a feminist critique and expansion of liberalism in the book Justice, Gender, and the Family.

Give this general term used by medieval philosophers to describe paradoxes of self-reference like the Liar’s paradox. Much medieval interest in these problems was sparked by a passage in Aristotle’s Sophistical Refutations.
Bradwardine and other philosophers interested in insolubles formed this group, including William Heytesbury and John Dumbleton. Members of this group made mathematical discoveries like the mean speed theorem.
This French philosopher returned to questions about insolubles throughout his career, generally arguing that they are false. He’s also the namesake of a paradox about an ass caught between two bundles of hay.

Name this philosopher whose social constructionist account of gender culminated in the book Resisting Reality, which also attempts to extend that project to race.
Haslanger’s introduction to that book cites this philosopher’s claim that “the lore of our fathers is a fabric of sentences.” Louise Antony read this man as feminist in a paper on the “radical import of naturalized epistemology.”
Resisting Reality also disputes Ian Hacking’s interpretation of this earlier philosopher as social constructionist. Haslanger provides her own reading of this woman’s claim that “one is not born, but rather becomes, a woman.”

Words like “thing” or “object” lack individuating criteria and thus exemplify “dummy” concepts of <em>this</em> kind, according to David Wiggins, whose book <em>Sameness and Substance</em> promotes essentialism with respect to them. For 10 points each:
Name this philosophical term that describes a principle for identifying or distinguishing particulars from each other and allows them to be counted together. Quine described them as terms “that divide their reference.”
The term “sortal” was coined to denote both real and nominal essences in this book by John Locke, which rejects Aristotelian essentialism but allows that experience allows us to make nominal essences.
In their debate over sortals, Quine and Peter Geach discussed the example of a statue and the gold from which it was made, a pairing that’s also the object of much discussion in this area of philosophy, which is concerned with the relations of parts to wholes.

Identify this hypothetical location born from supposedly misguided identity politics. A late Mark Fisher essay describes “exiting” this location, the fifth law of which is “think like a liberal (because you are one).”
Fisher’s Flatline Constructs examines the transition from “horror at” to “acceptance of” the movement of supposedly inanimate objects. The book takes as a starting point the observation that “our machines are disturbingly lively, while we ourselves are frighteningly inert” made in this author’s “Cyborg Manifesto.”
In one of the more popular posts on his influential K-Punk blog, Mark Fisher claimed that being a follower of this philosopher is “both the easiest and the hardest thing in the world.” In that post Fisher linked cybernetics’ basis in “feedback” to this Dutch philosopher’s account of emotion in his Ethics.

In his 1999 book about Knowledge in a Social World, Goldman claimed that knowledge plays a privileged role in the “special domains” of science, law, democracy and education.

This author of Minima Moralia attacked Marcuse by writing that “the thinking denigrated by actionists apparently demands too much undue effort: it requires too much work, is too practical.”
In a chapter about Minima Moralia, this philosopher declared that “if Lukács [LOO-kahsh] has turned Marxism into method, Adorno has turned it into the search for style.” This author of The Melancholy Science analogized Kant’s project of reason to the practice of law in courts in Dialectic of Nihilism.

The testimonial form of this situation arises from biases in the “economy of incredulity,” while its “hermeneutical” form is due to structural issues in society that prevent marginalised groups from intelligibly processing their experiences.
A common account of testimony relies on a “norm” by which one ought to assert a proposition only if they stand in this relation to the subject. Timothy Williamson advocated for this kind of norm in a book titled for this state and its Limits.

In “Against Marriage and Motherhood” this philosopher argued that LGBT marriage-rights advocacy fails to criticise western parental norms. In The Atrocity Paradigm, this philosopher distinguished evil from other sorts of wrongdoing by the actor’s culpability as well as the foreseeability of the intolerable harm caused.

Among the foremost teachers and theorists of rhetoric in the Roman Empire was this first-century man, who hailed from Hispania. His Institutio Oratoria served as a popular textbook of rhetoric, and advocates, among other things, for early primary education.
Rhetoric students in the Roman Empire made use of these writing exercises, which progressed in difficulty from storytelling to argumentation. A surviving handbook of them by Aphthonius of Antioch drew on the popular set of them developed by his teacher Libanius.

Name this author of the Summa Logicae, who attacked many of John Duns Scotus’s positions in his Ordinatio.
Ockham’s first brand of nominalism held that universals are not real things with subjective being, but instead have only this objective kind of being in the soul. The theory named for this word is contrasted with his later intellection-based theory derived from Aristotle’s On Interpretation.
Ockham took Aristotle’s set of these ten types of subjects of predicates and reduced it to just three: quality, substance and, because of its use in Trinitarian thought, relation.

For 10 points each—answer the following about women who improved on the work of John Rawls:
This Harvard philosopher, whose dissertation Rawls advised, used Rawls’s “concept/conception distinction” to analyse how “the right and the good are [just] names for problems…that spring from our reflective nature” in her book The Sources of Normativity.
Danielle Allen borrowed from Rawls’s “Two Concepts of Rules” to justify this process’s contribution to equality in her Tanner lectures. John Dewey argued that this process is “to social life” what “nutrition and reproduction are to physiological life” in a book titled for Democracy and [this thing].
Rawls’s strain of liberalism also inspired this thinker’s first book, Liberal Equality. In Democratic Education, this woman argued that education ought to produce a deliberative character in students, because citizens of a democracy must be able to criticize authority if they are to constitute a “society of sovereign citizens.”

Words like “thing” or “object” lack individuating criteria and thus exemplify “dummy” concepts of <em>this</em> kind, according to David Wiggins, whose book <em>Sameness and Substance</em> promotes essentialism with respect to them. For 10 points each:
Name this philosophical term that describes a principle for identifying or distinguishing particulars from each other and allows them to be counted together. Quine described them as terms “that divide their reference.”
The term “sortal” was coined to denote both real and nominal essences in this book by John Locke, which rejects Aristotelian essentialism but allows that experience allows us to make nominal essences.
In their debate over sortals, Quine and Peter Geach discussed the example of a statue and the gold from which it was made, a pairing that’s also the object of much discussion in this area of philosophy, which is concerned with the relations of parts to wholes.

This political theorist wrote a book called Colloquium of the Seven, in which a Muslim, Calvinist, Jew, skeptic, Calvinist, Lutheran, and philosopher try to find true religion in dialogue, but fail, leading to a justification of religious toleration. He also advocates for toleration in his Six Books of the Commonwealth.

The final thesis presented in this work is that "the differences between the well-known English writers on [the title discipline] from Sidgwick to the present day are of little importance." For 10 points each:
Name this essay, which suggests that the title discipline should be set aside until a sufficient grounding in philosophy of psychology is established. It originated the term "consequentialism."
"Modern Moral Philosophy" was written by G.E.M. Anscombe, who translated this Wittgenstein book into English. It argues against the possibility of a private language through the "beetle-in-a-box" argument.
Consequentialism contrasts with this rule-based form of ethics exemplified by Immanuel Kant's categorical imperative. It holds that people should act according to means-restricting norms, not just for the optimal end.

It was first articulated by Eubulides of Miletus, who proposed a thought experiment which asks when a man becomes bald if we remove his hair one hair at a time. For 10 points each:
Identify this paradox, more typically called the "paradox of the heap" which asks when a heap of grain stops being a heap if we remove one grain of sand from it at a time.
The sorites paradox arises due to terms possessing this property, which Peirce defined as a possible state of things which are intrinsically uncertain. Broadly speaking, this property refers to terms which are ill-defined.
According to this approach to vagueness, vague statements should be made clearer so as to satisfy a "completability requirement" and assign a truth value to them. This is an alternate approach to fuzzy logic.
