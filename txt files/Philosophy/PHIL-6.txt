Answer the following about eliminativism, for 10 points each.
Patricia Churchland’s magnum opus combines the name of this field with philosophy, reflecting her eliminative perspective on the mind. This field studies the physical aspects of the nervous system.
The Churchlands are often in agreement with Daniel Dennett, whose eliminativist ideas stem in part from being one of the “Four Horsemen” of this belief. Sam Harris’s first two books promoted this belief, which he has defended from criticism by William Lane Craig.
In one paper, Dennett attempted to “quine” away these phenomena with 15 intuition pumps. Chalmers’ “hard problem of consciousness” concerns why sentient creatures have these individual units of subjective experience.

A thought experiment by Laplace about a demon who knows every particle’s position and momentum was an early articulation of this position, which has since been frustrated by the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. For 10 points each:
Name this philosophical position whose hard form denies the existence of free will. It asserts that all actions are at least somewhat pre-ordained.
Due to the rise of quantum mechanics, Sir Arthur Eddington asserted that this indeterministic phenomenon really exists, contra Einstein’s insistence that “God does not play dice with the universe.”
This earlier thinker coined the term tychism (“TYKE-ism”) to describe a belief in indeterminate chance. This American rejected the methods of tenacity for scientific thinking in “The Fixation of Belief.”

chance [or probability; or fortune; or luck; prompt on randomness]
C. S. Peirce (“purse”) [or Charles Sanders Peirce] &lt;Philosophy&gt;
This field was kickstarted by a response to Celsus’s <em>The True Word</em>, which had characterized Christianity as an illegitimate cross-breed of eastern ideas. For 10 points each:
Identify this branch of theology that includes Origen’s Contra Celsum. C. S. Lewis’s The Screwtape Letters falls under the purview of this field, which generally refers to all defenses of Christianity against its detractors.
The Summa contra Gentiles is a well-known work of apologetics by this Doctor of the Church, who gave five possible arguments for the existence of God in his Summa Theologica.
The subfield of moral apologetics, which emphasizes humans’ status as sinful creatures in need of redemption, is exemplified by this violent 1741 sermon given by Jonathan Edwards during the First Great Awakening.

Nietzsche (“NEE-chuh”) mocked this thinker’s gravitas (“GRAV-ih-toss”) by saying that he believed “he and no one else was the true fulfiller… of the Delphic maxim ‘know thyself.’” For 10 points each:
Name this pre-Socratic thinker credited with inventing the dialectic. One of his statements is translated as “everything flows and nothing abides,” reflecting his belief that “the only constant is change.”
Hegel (“HAY-gull”) said that “there is no proposition of Heraclitus which I have not adopted” in the first lecture of a series on the philosophy of this concept. Hegel asserted that Africa did not have this concept because the world-spirit had not yet reached it.
The first of the three laws of dialectic by this Young Hegelian (“huh-GAIL-ee-in”) borrows from Heraclitus’s thought on the “unity and conflict” of opposites. He worked with Karl Marx on The Communist Manifesto.

In <em>The Great Transformation</em>, Karen Armstrong argued that the Enlightenment was a “second” period of this name, which was coined in <em>The Origin and Goal of History</em>. For 10 points each:
Name this period between 800 BC and 200 BC proposed by Karl Jaspers (“YOSS-purs”). In this age, monotheistic religions like Zoroastrianism emerged and the philosophies of Greece, China, India, Persia, and Israel developed in parallel.
Modern scholars sometimes include the author of this pessimistic Jewish text as an Axial Age figure. Its opening asserts that “All is vanity.”
Karl Jaspers included this Axial Age figure alongside Buddha, Confucius, and Jesus as a “paradigmatic individual.” Despite what Philo of Judea reports, it is doubtful that he taught Jewish ideas to students like Plato.

Those studies of Don Juan appear in this thinker’s Either/Or, which he self-published under various pseudonyms in his native Copenhagen. He also wrote Fear and Trembling.
In Kierkegaard’s Either/Or, Judge B rejects A’s separation of spheres of life named for the aesthetic and this concept. In Fear and Trembling, Johannes de Silento answers the question of whether there is a teleological suspension of this concept by referring to Abraham’s seemingly illogical sacrifice of Isaac.

the ethical [or word forms like ethics; accept morals] &lt;Philosophy&gt;
The field of philosophy of action is often traced back to this thinker’s monograph <em>Intention</em>. For 10 points each:
Name this analytical Thomist (“TOM-ist”) who introduced the term “consequentialism” in the paper “Modern Moral Philosophy.” This student of Ludwig Wittgenstein is credited with reviving virtue ethics in that paper.
This early text includes practical wisdom, or phronesis (“fro-NEE-sis”), as one of the five intellectual virtues. It asserts that the highest good is a state of “energeic” happiness called eudaimonia (“yoo-da-MO-nee-uh”).
Phillipa Foot’s neo-Aristotelian virtue ethics have been overshadowed by her invention of this dilemma. It asks if you should pull a lever to make the namesake vehicle run over only one person, rather than five.

The lecture series “Society Must Be Defended” argues that Marx and Engels transmuted a “counterhistory” of struggle on account of this thing into “class struggle.” For 10 points each:
Name this concept. An influential taxonomy of these things created by Johann Friedrich Blumenbach divides humans into Malayan, American, Mongolian, Ethiopian, and Caucasian varieties.
Michel Foucault’s analysis of race in “Society Must Be Defended” is largely based upon this Foucauldian (“foo-KO-dee-in”) concept. It refers to the means that the State uses to control the bodies of their subjects.
This three-volume study by Foucault contains the first printed use of “biopower.” It rejects the “Victorian” hypothesis that bourgeois capitalism repressed the title concept before examining Greco-Roman homoeroticism.

The Yogachara (“yo-ga-CHAH-ruh”) school’s notion of <em>Vijnapti-matram</em> (“vij-NOP-tee MAW-thrum”) is usually interpreted as a version of this perspective, since it holds that the world is an “unreal object.” For 10 points each:
Name this view. George Berkeley’s (“BARK-lee’s”) “immaterialism” is another variant of this position, which holds that only minds and mental constructs truly exist.
Samuel Johnson made the first argumentum ad lapidem by performing this specific action and proclaiming “I refute it thus” when discussing Berkeley’s “ingenious sophistry to prove the non-existence of matter.”
Berkeley attacked the fluxions used by this other thinker as “ghosts of departed quantities.” Berkeley’s De motu opposes the notions of absolute space and time argued in this physicist’s Principia Mathematica.

Gilles Deleuze (“zheel duh-LOOZ”) argued that this philosopher differentiated morality, which makes prohibitive “You must” statements, from ethics, which explains how our actions change our modes of being, in a book on his “Practical Philosophy.” For 10 points each:
Name this philosopher whose magnum opus takes its structure from Euclid’s Elements and is thus subtitled Demonstrated in Geometrical Order. That book is his Ethics.
Spinoza repeated the phrase “God or nature” four times in his Ethics because he believed in this doctrine. This belief conflates God with all things in the universe.
This fourth of the five chapters of Spinoza’s Ethics begins by defining perfection, imperfection, good, and evil. Its argument that humans are slaves to their emotions is counteracted by the last chapter, which proposes intellect as a means for “Human Freedom.”

In an abandoned sequel to this book, the unfaithful Sophie leaves the protagonist, who had earlier learned of natural religion from a Savoyard vicar in this book. For 10 points each:
Name this educational treatise which proposed that women like Sophie should only be educated for the pleasure of men. Jean-Jacques Rousseau considered it his most important work.
This philosopher was prompted in part by the sexist views on women’s education presented in Émile to write A Vindication of the Rights of Women.
Rousseau’s belief that women soften men and deprive them of the masculinity of the ancients in part motivated a letter critiquing this other thinker’s proposition to establish a theater in Geneva. After that letter, this physicist resigned from co-editing the Encyclopédie with Denis Diderot.

This book concludes by restating a declaration made in its opening paragraph, that “Whereof one cannot speak thereof one must be silent.” For 10 points each:
Name this work of analytic philosophy structured around seven major propositions. Many of its ideas were rejected in its author’s later major work, Philosophical Investigations.
The Tractatus and Philosophical Investigations are both by this Austrian-born philosopher and laid the foundations for much analytic philosophy.
According to the Tractatus, all complex propositions are truth-functions of these simpler sorts of propositions. Wittgenstein calls one of these propositions a “nexus” or “concatenation of names.”

Answer the following about the radical 11th-century philosopher al-Ma’ari, a philosopher who pissed off al-Qaeda so much that they beheaded his statue, for 10 points each.
al-Ma’ari viewed the Quran as a “set of idle tales,” instead choosing to express this sort of view of God. Many of the Founding Fathers held this view, which is often said to limit God’s role to a “divine watchmaker.”
al-Ma’ari was very accomplished in this literary form, whose practitioners should be expelled from an ideal city according to Plato’s Republic. Major practitioners of this form who dabbled in philosophy include Samuel Taylor Coleridge.
al-Ma’ari also held this philosophical position, which has been expounded by South African philosopher David Benatar in such books as The Human Predicament. This position holds that procreation is immoral.

Give this two-word phrase that denotes a shift in philosophical focus away from absolute idealism to the connections between words and reality, as seen in the work of Gottlob Frege (“FRAY-guh”).
Rorty was an analytic philosopher before founding a “new” version of this American philosophical tradition. Its adherents, such as William James, emphasized applying practical tests to ideas.
Rorty turned his attention to pragmatism after reading the works of Wilfred Sellars and this other analytic philosopher, who discussed the structure–content distinction in “Two Dogmas of Empiricism.”

Name this German author of the Kallias letters who also wrote the play Mary Stuart.
Schiller’s letters, like a lot of aesthetics, focused on this quality. This concept, which can be defined as aesthetic appeal, is contrasted with the sublime in the works of Edmund Burke.
The Aesthetic Letters postulate a “drive” named for this concept and suggest that man is “only fully a human being” when he engages in it. In another context, Jacques Derrida suggested that this concept can manipulate signs via the “movement of supplementarity.”

Identify this concept from legal theory. In a treatise on this concept, Hugo Grotius wrote that it could be compelled by the law of nature, the law of nations, and divine law.
The phrase “just war” was first used in this book, which says that a “wise man” should “lament the necessity” of just war. This book, which was written after the sack of Rome in 410 AD, argues against Platonic natural theology.
This author of The City of God and Church father also wrote a book of autobiographical Confessions.

Name this Swiss theorist whose works of political philosophy include the Discourse on Inequality, as well as a book discussing the “general will” titled The Social Contract.
Rousseau claimed the origins of society produced this form of esteem that is dependent on others. This concept, known by a French name, is contrasted with the notion of amour de soi (“ah-MOOR duh swah”).
Rousseau was one of many 18th-century philosophers to idealize this archetypal view of primitive peoples who are “uncorrupted” by civilization. Native Americans were often considered to be examples of this archetype known by a two-word name.

Name this philosopher who enumerated ten different types of things that can be the subjects or predicates of propositions in his treatise Categories.
Sophistical Refutations and Categories are part of Aristotle’s Organon, which is a set of writings on this discipline. George Boole, who names a variety of this discipline, wrote about it in The Laws of Thought.
This philosopher’s major work, which is an introduction to Aristotle’s Categories, served as the major introductory medieval textbook on logic. He also edited the Enneads of his teacher Plotinus.

Name this subfield of linguistics that studies both the context in which utterances are made, and the implications of that context. This subfield studies deictic (“DIKE-tick”) expressions like “here” or “that.”
Pragmatics is closely related to this other subfield of linguistics, which studies the meaning of utterances.
This analytic philosopher’s theory of “performative utterances” is central to the field of pragmatics, and was introduced in his lecture series published under the title How to Do Things With Words.

After this thinker’s heart stopped when he ate his favorite smoked salmon, he wrote an account of what he saw after his brief death. For 10 points each:
Name this British philosopher who introduced the concept of the “verification principle” from the Vienna Circle to Anglophone philosophy. He wrote The Problem of Knowledge.
The positions of the Vienna Circle that Ayer introduced are called the “logical” variety of this empirical approach, which rejects metaphysics and instead grounds knowledge in verifiable reality. Auguste Comte promoted this approach in sociology.
Much earlier, this Scottish philosopher also promoted an empirical approach to knowledge in such books as An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding.

Name this ancient philosopher who introduced the principles of atomism to the Romans in his poem De rerum natura, or “On the Nature of Things.”
Lucretius was a follower of this man, who advocated striving for ataraxia, or freedom from distress. He names a school of philosophy which seeks pleasure as the ultimate goal in life.
Epicurus argued that the clinamen, or swerve, of atoms allows for this concept. Compatibilism argues that this concept can coexist with determinism.

Answer the following about the philosophy of Bernard Williams. For 10 points each:
Williams introduced the moral type of this concept, which he described as situations in which a person’s actions depend on factors beyond their control, yet they are still blamed for the consequences.
In a book subtitled “For and Against,” Bernard Williams criticized this ethical system for denying moral agency and treating humans as empty vessels for consequences. This ethical system was formulated by Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill as “the greatest happiness for the greatest number.”
Williams’ formulation of moral luck was used to criticize this earlier philosopher’s moral theories. In the Dialectic of Enlightenment, this thinker’s views of enlightenment are argued to be a source of barbarism and violence.

Name this author of The Book of Healing. This thinker said that he had read one Aristotle work 40 times before al-Farabi’s commentaries allowed him to understand.
The aforementioned Aristotle work was titled for this field. Avicenna argued that since nothing could be the subject of its own study, God could not be the subject of this field. Centuries later, Carnap tried to “eliminate” this field of philosophy.
Avicenna’s floating man proof of the existence of the soul is similar to this man’s “cogito ergo sum” proof of his own existence, which was formulated in his Meditations on First Philosophy.

Name this thinker whose bundle theory argues that all objects are composed of a collection of perceptions. This thinker also presented a thought experiment about a missing shade of blue.
Hume is a famous proponent of this school of thought, which is often contrasted with rationalism. John Locke advocated for this school which argues that knowledge is derived from sensory experience.
Hume advanced a distinction between these things and “ideas,” arguing that ideas are less intensely perceived than these things. Hume’s copy principle holds that these things are the origins of all ideas.

This English philosopher, who may have originated the phrase “knowledge is power,” formulated an early example of the scientific method in his book Novum Organum.
In this author’s history of science, The Structure of Scientific Revolutions, he details the consequences of breakthroughs in the field of science, exploring how paradigm shifts impact the research of scientists.
This work, originally sponsored by Cardinal Corsini, proposed that man arose from a “beastial age.” This work by an early 18th-century Italian philosopher argues that history is relatively cyclical in nature and sought to develop a science of humanity.

A descriptivist theory of names was put forth by this thinker in his book A System of Logic. He’s better known for advancing the “greatest-happiness principle” in his Utilitarianism.
This philosopher rebuked Mill’s theory by proposing a distinction between “sense” and “reference.” He illustrated the former with the example of how both Hesperus and Phosphorus refer to the planet Venus.
Later philosophers described “fixing” and “borrowing” in a theory of reference described by this process. Mill’s five methods of induction illustrate this process, which Aristotle divided into material, formal, efficient, and final types.

This philosopher was unsure whether the world existed, but he at least proved that he himself existed with the phrase “I think, therefore I am” and proceeded from there with induction.
This philosopher called knowledge of the external world “sensitive knowledge” and said that it is different enough from “knowledge of appearances” to conclude that the world exists. This thinker’s conception of abstract ideas is attacked in another philosopher’s Treatise Concerning the Principles of Human Knowledge.

This propositional attitude occurs if a person thinks that a statement is true, whether it actually is or not. For 10 points each:
Identify this type of proposition. The “justified true” type of these propositions were traditionally equated with knowledge, though modern philosophers have argued that those conditions are insufficient.
In a 1963 paper, this philosopher described various scenarios in which justified true belief does not constitute knowledge. Similar scenarios are called this man’s namesake cases.
Analysis of justified true belief falls under this branch of philosophy that studies the nature of knowledge. Historical theories within this branch of philosophy include empiricism, idealism and rationalism.
