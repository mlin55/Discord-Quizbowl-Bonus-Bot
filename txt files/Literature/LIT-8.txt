For 10 points each—name some poems examined in Camille Paglia’s book Break, Blow, Burn.
Break, Blow, Burn takes its title from a line in this John Donne sonnet, whose speaker complains that God “As yet but knock[s], breathe[s], shine[s], and seek[s] to mend.”
Paglia used this poem as the “ultimate standard” for her book, praising its “sinewy modern English.” It describes a “shape with lion body and the head of a man” that stirs “somewhere in sands of the desert.”
The final essay in Break, Blow, Burn examines the lyrics of this song, which Paglia describes as the most influential English-language poem since “Daddy.” Paglia interprets its singer’s dream of bombers “turning into butterflies above our nation” in the context of her disillusionment with 60’s counterculture.

Protagoras created a paradox widely discussed by Renaissance logicians like Lorenzo Valla by arranging to be paid under this condition. Leibniz created a solution where the student pays him during a repetition of the scenario.
The Cyrenaic philosopher Theodoros the Atheist was infamous for both vocal asébeia, or impiety, and for snarky debates with Hipparchia of Maroneia, a member of this school. This school founded by Antisthenes advocated askesis along with the Stoics.

Name this subject of a 2013 debate touched off by Emily Apter’s book “against” it. The German word from which this term derives was coined in a conversation with Johann Eckermann to describe how poetry is becoming the “universal possession of mankind.”
Apter’s Against World Literature claims that Goethe’s idea of world literature ignores the politics of works that can’t fully be subjected to this general process. Wole Soyinka performed this task on Daniel Fagunwa’s Yoruba language work to bring it to an Anglophone audience.
The n+1 article published with Apter’s book cites this author’s supposedly fading powers after his university appointment as an example of the university insulating “World Lit from the world it wants to describe and address” and criticizes his 2006 book The Wizard of the Crow.

This Zora Neale Hurston novel about Janie Crawford opens by declaring that “ships at a distance have every man’s wish on board.”
This critic theorized that Hurston’s passage rewrites Douglass’s apostrophe by turning male desire into an object, one example of the title type of revision in his book The Signifying Monkey.

Name this structure that Roithamer builds in the exact center of the Kobernausser forest as a house for a female relative in the novel Correction.
Correction is by this German-language author, whose novels The Loser and Extinction also use his trademark style of obsessive monologues and contain jibes at his much-hated native country.

The illicit Living Room Theater movement in Czechoslovakia inspired a short Stoppard play in which Cahoot stages this play. David Greig’s play Dunsinane begins after this play’s title character has been defeated by Malcolm.

Name these writings, one of which is often called a manifesto of literary impressionism; that one declares that “my task which I am trying to achieve . . . is before all, to make you see.”
More explicitly than Conrad did in his preface to The Narcissus, this friend of and collaborator with Conrad championed literary impressionism and attempted to use it in his novel The Good Soldier.
In a surprising bit of metafiction, Conrad’s preface to Nostromo attributes his knowledge of this fictional South American country, Nostromo’s setting, to a book by the character Don José Avellanos. Juan Gabriel Vasquez wrote “The Secret History of” this country.

One of the few other 12th-century female composers whose work endured is this woman, whose song “A chantar” is the only canso by a female troubadour, or trobairitz, that survives with music intact.

Name this country whose ancient culture fascinated German romantic poet Friedrich Hölderlin (HOOL-dehr-lin), who used its alcaic stanza form and described how the “sea roars at Parnassus” in this country in his poem “Bread and Wine.”
In After Babel, George Steiner examined Hölderlin’s use of the phrase “my Zeus” in his translation of this ancient Greek work. In a notable reading of this work, Hegel argued that it depicts a public good and a private good each making a claim to exclusiveness.
A contemporary of Hölderlin with this surname claimed that Greek poetry was “objective,” while modern poetry is merely “interesting.” That critic of this surname published Athenaeum with his brother, August (OW-goost), a noted translator of Shakespeare.

Name this sort of text published by John Florio in 1603, from which Shakespeare lifted a speech in which Gonzalo imagines a “commonwealth” where “no kind of traffic” and “no name of magistrate” would be allowed.
Montaigne’s “Of Cannibals” inspired that utopian speech by Gonzalo in this Shakespeare play, in which it is followed by the spirit Ariel lulling the stranded lords to sleep.
This critic edited an edition of Florio’s translation that was published under the title Shakespeare’s Montaigne in 2014. This theorizer of Renaissance “self-fashioning” applied his method of New Historicism in the Shakespeare biography Will in the World.

A sequence of the letters praises the peaceful way of life of members of this sect on Nantucket. Much of The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin is set in a city founded as a safe haven for this Christian sect.
One of the letters describes a “Russian gentleman’s” visit to a Quaker botanist with this surname. That botanist's son William wrote a book of “travels” whose lush descriptions of Southern locales like the “Isle of Palms” influenced Felicia Hemans’s “The Isle of Founts” and Samuel Taylor Coleridge’s “Kubla Khan.”

Name this city. An author working in this city wrote a poem addressing people who want their lovers to be Thaïs (“tah-EES”) and their wives to be Lucretia and who “adjoin flesh and world and devil,” titled “You Foolish Men.”
This long philosophical poem by the Baroque Mexican author of “You Foolish Men” opens by describing the “pyramidal death-born shadow” of “vain obelisks.” It ends with the statement “The World illuminated and I awake.”
Bernardo de Balbuena’s Mexico’s Grandeur is framed as a reply to one of these people. This was the vocation of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, the author of First Dream.

The Young Visiters was published with a preface by this creator of Peter Pan, leading to persistent rumors that it was he, and not Ashford, who actually wrote it.
This author’s parody of The Young Visiters, entitled The Young Immigrunts, is the source of perhaps his most quotable sentence: “‘Shut up,’ he explained.”
The rampant spelling errors in The Young Visiters, including in the title, recall the spelling error in the title of this piece of juvenilia by Jane Austen, written mostly in the form of letters from Laura to Marianne.

Name this subject of a W. H. Auden elegy which describes him as an “important Jew who died in exile” who studied the “fauna of the night” and “told the unhappy Present to recite the Past.”
Auden later wrote a similar elegy for this poet, which calls the day of his death a “dark cold day” and claims “Mad Ireland hurt you into poetry.” This poet included “Leda and the Swan” in his collection The Tower.
This poet, whom Auden popularized in the U.S., modeled his “Verses on the Death of T. S. Eliot” on “In Memory of W. B. Yeats.” He wrote an elegy for a metaphysical poet describing him as having “sunk in sleep.”

Name this formulaic genre of drama popularized in nineteenth-century France by authors like Victorien Sardou.
Eugène Scribe (“oo-zhen screeb”), credited with inventing the well-made play, also used its formula for a number of these written works set to music by Giacomo Meyerbeer. Pierre Beaumarchais’s (“boh-mar-SHAY’s”) Figaro trilogy inspired a number of these works.
This playwright lambasted the well-made play in his “The Quintessence of Ibsenism.” Ironically, its effect on his own work can be seen in a play concerning the poet Eugene Marchbanks’s attempts to court the elderly wife of Reverend James Morell.

Yunior’s narration of a Junot (“JOO-noh”) Díaz novel about this character’s “brief wondrous life” uses code-switching to relate this character’s upbringing in Paterson under the shadow of Trujillo’s regime and the “fukú” curse.
Díaz’s collection Drown opens with a quote from Bilingual Blues, a collection by Gustavo Pérez Firmat, a poet from this country. Pedro Juan Gutiérrez wrote a sordid trilogy whose title calls this country’s capital “dirty.”

Edmund Wilson slammed an English translation of this work by attributing to it “a lack of common sense” and the translator’s desire to “torture both the reader and himself.” For 10 points each:
Name this novel written in a form of iambic tetrameter that alternates masculine and feminine rhymes, known as its title character’s “stanza.” Its title character incites a duel when he attends Tatyana’s name day celebration.
This writer earned Wilson’s ire for his extremely literal translation of Eugene Onegin, which he accompanied with an analysis of Russian and English verse called Notes on Prosody (“PRAH-zuh-dee”).
In Notes on Prosody, Nabokov writes that the beauty of this device in English is “the delicate sensation of something being physically preserved by the voice” and finds that it is absent in Russian. Robert Bridges explains syllabic variation between lines in Paradise Lost with this device in Milton’s Prosody.
