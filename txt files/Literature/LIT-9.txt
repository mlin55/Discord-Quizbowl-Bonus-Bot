Name this poet who infamously told Samuel Taylor Coleridge that The Rime of the Ancient Mariner’s only faults were “that it was improbable, and had no moral.”

Rosenzweig’s theory of “speech thinking” in part 2 of The Star of Redemption anticipates this 1923 book, which details five ways of relating to a tree. Rosenzweig later translated the Old Testament with this book’s author.
Buber and Rosenzweig’s etymological approach to “Germanization” led them to translate korban as “nearing,” rather than this primary meaning. One type of this practice can be translated as “holocaust.”

Name this Parisian theater known for its naturalistic horror shows, whose name came to signify the genre during the early twentieth century.
This man likened World War I-era London to a horror show with two novels titled Guignol’s Band. This massive anti-Semite also wrote Journey to the End of the Night.
This book by Julia Kristeva claims that Céline’s use of ellipsis in Castle to Castle creates a suspense that “make[s] the Grand Guignol…look like a kindergarten.” This book is primarily an analysis of the “abject.”

This post-structuralist French critic wrote S/Z, as well as Mythologies and “The Death of the Author.”
Post-structuralist critics often use the “semiotic square” introduced in this author’s book Structural Semantics. This theorist, who left his native Lithuania during World War II, also developed the “actantial model,” which breaks down a narrative action into six “actants.”

Wáng Yángmíng led an intuitionist school of this philosophical movement. The “Four Books” were selected by this movement’s leading light Zhū Xī [joo shee].
In a classic statement of his idealism, Wáng Yángmíng claimed that the mind is “master” of Heaven, Earth, and this number of things. This number is used in texts like the Dào dé jīng to stand in for “a large number,” and is thus often translated as “myriad.”

Name these events. A “planetary” one of these events is posited in the subtitle of Hito Steyerl’s Duty Free Art, which distinguishes between the repetition of history that Marx calls farce and the improvisational historical looping that one sees in the Tom Cruise film The Edge of Tomorrow.
Steyerl draws on this author’s book Stasis: Civil War as a Political Paradigm in her analysis of Edge of Tomorrow. While Statis focused on Athenian politics, this author is better known for tracing the notion of a “state of exception” back to Roman law.
Like Steyerl, Stephen Mulhall has written philosophical treatments of Tom Cruise films, analyzing the Mission Impossible films through the philosophy of this anti-Semitic author of Being and Time.

Kono won this semi-annual Japanese literary prize for her 1963 short story “Crab.” This prize is named for the author of “Autumn Mountain” and “Hell Screen.”
Kono cites this literary work as the inspiration for her depictions of sadomasochism, and wrote a travelogue about her pilgrimage to its author’s home at Haworth. This book, which features a scene in which the protagonist asks her father to buy her a whip, was also the basis for Minae Mizamura’s 2002 work A True Novel.

Name this novel by Rachel Kushner that opens with Reno crashing her motorcycle trying to photograph the tracks on the sand she leaves on the Bonneville Salt Flats.
In The Flamethrowers, Reno idolizes the racer Flip Farmer and his record-breaking car the Victory of Samothrace, in an obvious reference to Filippo Marinetti’s manifesto for this violence and speed-obsessed art movement.
A memorable set piece in The Flamethrowers, the New York City blackout of 1977, was inspired by this novel’s description of the Northeast power outage of 1965, which strikes just days after its waste management executive protagonist first meets his unfaithful wife Marian.

Virgil’s phrase “Sale Saxa Sonabant” is an example of what repetition of the same consonant at the start of successive words?
Pontano also examined the doubly-alliterative phrase “Multa Munita Virum Vi” in this poem, whose first book begins by addressing Venus as the “mother of Rome,” and later declares that “nothing can be born of nothing, nothing can be resolved into nothing.”
Ancient Roman writers and modern classicists alike mocked the excessively alliterative line “o tite, tute, tati, tibi tanta, tyranne, tulisti!” from this 2nd-century BC epic poem by Quintus Ennius, the preeminent verse narrative about Roman history until it was supplanted by Virgil’s Aeneid.

This author chose the title “Land-locked” for Thaxter’s first poem, which he published in The Atlantic Monthly without her permission. At least she fared better than Edgar Allan Poe, whom this poet proclaimed “three-fifths… genius and two-fifths sheer fudge.”
Thaxter’s cottage at Appledore Island attracted Longfellow, Whittier, and other members of this group of American poets, whose multiple nicknames reflect either the tendency of families to read them by the hearth or for children to be asked to recite them in class.

The Bulgarian literary critic Tzvetan Todorov coined the term “narratology” in a study identifying “punishment avoided” and “conversion” as the two main storylines of this collection, citing as an example of the former Dioneo’s first day tale about a monk getting caught with a woman in his room by an elder abbot.
This French narratologist coined the term “paratext” for the cover art, prefaces, and other material surrounding books, and suggested parsing the syntax of complex narratives such as In Search of Lost Time by identifying the “focalization" of narrative mood, in his multi-volume work Figures I-III.

In a notorious 1976 article for the Soho Daily News, John Calvin Batchelor attempted to account for Salinger’s disappearance from the public eye by peddling a conspiracy theory that the writer took this specific radical action to escape the burden of writing about the Glass family.

Name this quality which is mentioned fifty-two times throughout Othello, usually as an epithet or metonym for Iago.
This critic examined the usage of “honesty” in Othello to mean sexual faithfulness and truth-telling in an essay from his collection The Structure of Complex Words. In his debut 1930 book, he identified the usage of a single word to suggest multiple connected ideas as one of the title ways that poetry can sustain multiple valid readings.
In another essay from Complex Words, Empson notes that the word “all” is used “whenever there is any serious emotional pressure” in this poem, as in its attribution of “all our woe” to “the fruit / Of the forbidden tree” in the opening lines. According to Empson, Satan is the true hero of this epic poem.

This critic examined the usage of “honesty” in Othello to mean sexual faithfulness and truth-telling in an essay from his collection The Structure of Complex Words. In his debut 1930 book, he identified the usage of a single word to suggest multiple connected ideas as one of the title ways that poetry can sustain multiple valid readings.
In another essay from Complex Words, Empson notes that the word “all” is used “whenever there is any serious emotional pressure” in this poem, as in its attribution of “all our woe” to “the fruit / Of the forbidden tree” in the opening lines.

For Bloom’s money, the best parody of “Resolution and Independence” is a poem about an “aged aged man” who “hunt[s] for haddocks’ eyes / Among the heather bright / And work[s] them into waistcoat-buttons / In the silent night,” which the White Knight sings to Alice in this novel by Lewis Carroll.

Name this country, the subject of an “Ode” by Paul Laurence Dunbar and a “Ballad” by Langston Hughes. It was traditionally used as a metonym for blackness and Africa in Western poetry.
An early example of Ethiopia as metonym comes from this author’s “divine epigram” “On the Baptized Ethiopian.” A Latin epigram by this clergyman about the wedding at Cana contains a line usually translated as “the modest water saw its God, and blushed.”
The best-known reference to Ethiopia in English literature may be the opium-induced vision of an “Abyssinian maid” playing a dulcimer and singing of Mount Abora in this poem.

Name this four-word phrase uttered by Miles before he dies in Henry James’s The Turn of the Screw. Critics debate whether the last two words are addressed to a ghost or to the governess herself.
The “non-apparitionist” view that the governess is imagining the ghosts was popularized by this author in his 1934 essay “Ambiguity in Henry James,” which was later collected in his volume The Triple Thinkers.
In The Rhetoric of Fiction, Wayne Booth discusses the governess’ role in the The Turn of the Screw shortly after coining this two-word term for a speaker whose recounting of facts is not fully trustworthy.

This writer observed “How hard it is to escape from places,” because in doing so “you leave little bits of yourself fluttering on the fences.” Welty suggests that it was while she was “eleven thousand miles from home, out of homesickness” that this author wrote regional stories like “The Garden Party.”

Name this process that reformist journals such as Noah B. Cloud’s American Cotton Planter attempted to reverse by promoting the raising of more livestock.
Reformers’ attempts to get Southern planters to reverse soil exhaustion by using more manure were hampered by the dominance of this medical theory, which argued that diseases were spread by rotting organic matter through “bad air.”
Applying this substance to barns, outhouses, and cellars was a common antebellum method for combatting miasma. In a literary scene involving this substance, a character discovers that to make people covet something, “it is only necessary to make the thing difficult to attain.”

This work of literary criticism notes that Roussel’s poetic descriptions of tableaux vivants evoke a “daydream of life within life” that reveals the “essential theatricality of all miniatures.” This book by Susan Stewart examines the role of nostalgia in literary depictions of the miniature and the gigantic.
Stewart also notes the “intolerable burden” caused by Roussel’s famously heavy use of this punctuation mark, which occasionally created up to five nested levels of explanation in his work. Two of these punctuation marks enclose the phrase “a leaf falls” in an e. e. cummings poem.

This central concept in Cities of the Dead is defined by Roach as the mechanism through which culture reproduces itself “as actual or perceived vacancies occur” in the social fabric. It often involves the use of effigies.
Cities of the Dead was influenced by this thinker’s transnational analysis of the African diaspora in books like There Ain’t No Black in the Union Jack and The Black Atlantic.
Cities of the Dead focuses on London and this American city, arguing that “whiteface minstrelsy” and the figure of the “vanishing Indian” are two key touchstones for a celebration in this city that involves parades along St. Charles Avenue and Bourbon Street.

Name this H. G. Wells novel loosely based on the history of Coca-Cola, which follows George Ponderevo’s involvement with the title patent medicine.
In 1909, this author wrote to his friend Blanche Jennings, “you must, must read Tono-Bungay.” According to Edward Mendelson, this writer conceived of his novel Women in Love largely as a response to Wells’ book.
In his book Language of Fiction, this literary critic argued that Wells’ “descriptive commentary” on “Condition of England” represents the central character of Tono-Bungay. His other works include Consciousness and the Novel and The Modes of Modern Writing.

In books like Upheavals of Thought and Hiding from Humanity, this more recent thinker has argued that many of the emotional pathologies identified in Theweleit’s Male Fantasies are present in American society. She wrote about the role of international feminism in global development in the book Sex and Social Justice.

This novelist perpetuated the myth that “Berliner is also the vulgate idiom for a common jelly doughnut” and thus that JFK’s line was “greeted by the Teutonic crowds with a delight only apparently political” in his novel Infinite Jest.
In this author’s book Monstrous Regiment, Samuel Vimes attempts to say, “I am a Borogravian,” but instead declares himself to be a cherry pancake. That book is one of the few in this author’s major series not to focus primarily on The Watch, Death, Rincewind, or the Witches.
