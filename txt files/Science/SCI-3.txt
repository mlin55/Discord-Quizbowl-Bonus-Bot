Hotelling’s law is equivalent to this principle by which two companies with only a few differences in their products will attempt to homogenize their products even further, rather than trying to stand out from each other.
Hotelling’s rule describes the maximally profitable extraction path for a resource with this property. Coal, oil, and natural gas are this kind of resource, while wind and solar energy are not, since they can’t be “used up.”
Hotelling’s lemma states that the partial derivative of this function with respect to price equals the supply function. This function can be maximized by looking for points where marginal revenue equals marginal cost.

Answer the following about consequences of electrostatic induction, for 10 points each:
A common electroscope invented by Abraham Bennet uses thin leaves of this element, which attract each other when a charged rod approaches the electroscope but repel once the rod makes contact.
Electrostatic induction explains why this quantity is constant all inside of a conductor. This quantity, symbolized V, is equivalent to the electrical potential.
A conducting shell surrounding a point charge has zero electric field inside the conductor and also at this point. This point is considered to be the reference of zero voltage in most physics problems.

This quantity is defined as the sum over all possible values of probability times value, over all possible values. For 10 points each:
Name this quantity, which is equivalent to the center of mass of a probability distribution.
As the number of trials increases, this quantity should converge on the expected value. This quantity represents the average of a data set.
The expected value is only defined for this type of variable, which has an unknown value, and a probability distribution determining its potential states. These variables are often symbolized X.

This element was once more valuable than gold, until the Hall-Heroult process came out. For 10 points each:
Name this common metal with atomic number 13, which is used in foil and soda cans.
On the Periodic Table, aluminum lies right under the line dividing metals from nonmetals, which is often named for its resemblance for one of these household objects. The metalloids are said to lie on one of these objects.
This element in the nitrogen group is usually considered a metalloid. It was once used by Paul Ehrlich to treat syphilis-- a really bad idea--though nowadays it’s used to make semiconductors in combination with gallium.

The equivalence principle suggests that gravity can be considered this type of force. For 10 points each:
Name this type of force which exists only in a noninertial reference frame.
This force, which is often used to explain how a bucket full of water doesn’t empty out when it’s hurled around in a circle, is fictitious. It acts outward, unlike the centripetal force.
A principle named for this physicist states that a person’s inertia is dependent upon interactions with all other masses in the universe. This physicist’s namesake number, a ratio of speeds, determines if flow is compressible.

An “arithmetic” statement beginning with this word is used exclusively in FORTRAN. For 10 points each:
Name this word which introduces a conditional block that is more common than a switch-case statement.
The expression after an if must evaluate to one of these two values. Boolean expressions take on these two values.
Similarly to if-then-else statements, these two keywords are used with the word finally in many languages for exception handling. Control blocks using these two keywords throw exceptions to prevent undesired executions.

Name some classic examples of natural selection in the animal kingdom, for 10 points each:
This man discovered finches in the Galapagos Islands which evolved different beak sizes to account for varying diets. He first described evolution by natural selection.
In The Origin of Species, Darwin explains this animal’s most notable physical feature could have evolved to help it find food. This animal was used by Lamarck as evidence for the inheritance of acquired characteristics.
Another classical case of natural selection is the gradual darkening in color of this insect in response to the soot added to the air in England during the Industrial Revolution.

This quantity replaces the reaction quotient in the Nernst equation for a SHE cell. For 10 points each:
Name this quantity which is estimated qualitatively for a solution using a mixture containing methyl [METH-ill] red, methyl yellow, thymol blue, and bromo-thymol blue.
Quantitative measurements of pH are used in the potentiometric form of this technique. This technique determines the concentration of an unknown acid or base using a known volume of a known concentration liquid.
The reference electrode in a pH meter is almost always made of this opaque-white chloride compound. Like mercury and lead chloride, it is famously insoluble in water.

This form of radiation is emitted when accelerated electrons collide with a solid surface in bremssthrahlung. For 10 points each:
Name this form of radiation, less energetic than gamma rays, which is used in medical imaging.
X-rays can be used to identify the structure of proteins or crystals based on this physical effect. The angular spacing of the pattern produced from this process is given by Bragg’s Law.
X-ray diffraction is difficult, but the only other method to figure out the atomic structure of proteins is this technique. Samples for this technique are placed in namesake thin-wall glass tubes with deuterated chloroform.

7 bits can represent one character in this encoding scheme, which associates the numbers 0-127 to various characters and numbers. It is extended by Unicode.

Name this quantity, which is equivalent to energy according to Einstein.
Masses in astronomical terms are often given relative to either the Sun, or to this other planet, which is around 1000 times smaller than the Sun.
Stars of relatively low mass, like the Sun, will eventually follow this branch on the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram. This branch is named because it narrowly approaches the red giant branch.

The zeta potential of these systems is defined as the electric potential at their double layer. For 10 points each:
Name these systems in which one substance is dispersed in another. Specific types of these systems include aerosols, gels, and emulsions.
Shining light on colloids often makes them appear blue due to this effect. Similar to Rayleigh scattering, this effect is due to the particles more strongly scattering short wavelengths.
Colloids are stabilized in this process that uses a small amount of electrolyte. This process is the reverse of flocculation.

The first discovered virus is named for its infection of this plant. For 10 points each:
Name this plant in the Nicotiana genus, which can be infected by a namesake “mosaic virus.”
Tobacco contains a ton of carcinogens, which are chemicals that can cause this disease. Tobacco smoking is the main cause of the lung variety of this disease, which is due to uncontrolled cell growth forming malignant tumors.
This biological assay was introduced by its namesake in the 1970s as a way to test whether a chemical is carcinogenic. This assay works by detecting mutations in the synthesis of histidine.
