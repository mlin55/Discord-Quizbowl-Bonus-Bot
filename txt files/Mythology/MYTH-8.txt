As Aeneas approaches Buthrotum, he sees this woman libating the cenotaph of her first husband. After the fall of Troy, Neoptolemus executed this woman’s son and took her as a concubine before marrying her to Helenus.
The Trojans’ sojourn in Buthrotum occurs after their run-in with one of these birdlike creatures, who tells them that they will eventually “eat their own tables.” Some of these creatures stole the food of the Thracian king Phineus.

A work of Callimachus probably inspired the writing of this kind of myth by Roman poets. For 10 points each:
Name these myths that seek to explain the origins of practices, monuments, and phenomena by referring to events from the mythical past. An example of these myths is Ovid’s report that the suicides of Pyramus and Thisbe changed the color of mulberry fruits.
Book 5 of Ovid’s Metamorphoses includes an aetiology in which Ceres’s search for Proserpina with torches explains the use of torches in these Greek rituals. Initiates into these rituals consumed the psychoactive drug kykeon.
In Book I, Ovid’s description of the misdeeds of Lycaon aetiologizes this animal’s savagery. An aetiological myth in the Fasti explains the Lupercalia’s origin by relating how this animal suckled Romulus and Remus.

In the twelve-hour journey narrated in the Am’duat, this vehicle takes Ra through the underworld. While in this vehicle, Ra slays the serpent Apep in hour 7 each night.
Hours 4 and 5 of the Am’duat cover the realm of this god, the second-most famous falcon-headed god after Horus. This white-clad funerary deity of Memphis was later syncretized with Ptah, or with Ptah and Osiris as Ptah-this god’s name-Osiris.

Name this huge sea monster from Nordic legend. The Lutheran bishop Erik Pontoppidan popularized the idea that this creature is mistaken for islands and is as deadly for leaving behind whirlpools as it is for its tentacles.
The hafgufa appears in a saga named for this warrior, who also appears in the Tyrfing cycle. A prophecy that this man’s horse would kill him comes true when he kicks the long-dead horse’s skull and a snake comes out.
Örvar-Oddr also features in the Hloðskviða, which recounts a battle between the Goths and these people. A ruler of them who appears as “Etzel” in Germanic lore was said to wield a “Sword of God” found by a shepherd.

Answer the following about legends commemorated by temples in Tamil Nadu, for 10 points each.
The Meenakshi Temple is named for an incarnation of this member of the Tridevi born as a three-breasted, “fish-eyed” warrior queen to a royal couple praying for a son. Satī was reborn as this goddess after performing the original instance of her namesake self-immolation.
Meenakshi married Sundareswarar, who is unsurprisingly an avatar of this member of the Trimurti and “lord of the dance.” The Brihadishvara Temple in Thanjavur holds one of the largest lingams that symbolize this deity.
A temple in Villivakkam commemorates the spot where this sage killed two demons who would turn into fruit, trick travelers into eating it, then tear them apart from the inside. This husband of Lopamudra was born when the apsara Urvashi’s pure sexiness caused Varuna and Mitra to spontaneously ejaculate into the same mud pot.

Name these creatures from Korean mythology that, unlike their Western counterparts, were often benevolent and wise. One of these beings is the only mythical member of the Chinese zodiac.
A man known as the White Warrior killed a dragon that desolated the lands near this sacred mountain, creating Heaven Lake in the process. The legendary founder of Gojoseon, Dangun, was born on this mountain to Hwanung and Ungnyeo (oong-nyuh).
Ungnyeo was born a bear but, along with this animal, was allowed to become human if she could live in a cave for 100 days on mugwort and garlic. This animal failed the test by quitting after 20 days.

Name this Greek hero and son of Oeneus, whose death drove his sisters to such grief that Artemis turned them into guineafowl. His two sisters who remained human included Deianira, the wife of Heracles.
Because Oeneus forgot to sacrifice to Artemis, she sent this creature to ravage his lands. This creature was slain by Meleager, but Atalanta drew first blood and heroes like Theseus, Peleus, and Jason all helped in the great hunt.
Sources such as the lost Cypria state that Meleager’s daughter Polydora was the wife of this hero, a statue of whom urged her to commit suicide after this man’s death. Odysseus fatefully tricked this man by jumping on a shield.

After sacking Troy with Heracles, Telamon married Hesione, who bore him this son. This man was not allowed back in Salamis after the Trojan War because he failed to bring back the body of his half brother Ajax.
Teucer was foremost among the Greeks in the use of these weapons, which he wielded while protected behind Ajax’s shield. Philoctetes brought to Troy a set of these weapons that Heracles had infused with hydra venom.

By prophesying that her fifth son would be born with the image of a dragon on this body part, Aslaug proved to Ragnar that she was the child of Sigurd and Brynhild. Odin gave up one of these things in exchange for wisdom.

This largest city of Boeotia was founded by Cadmus. Amphion and Zethus built the walls of this city, which was attacked by seven men including Amphiaraus (“am-fee-uh-RAY-us”) and Polynices.
According to Pausanias, this race left Thessaly to found the Boeotian city of Orchomenus. In the Argonautica, Apollonius claims Jason’s mother was a member of this race, which is why the Argonauts are sometimes named after them.

In Rome, the goddess Cybele (“SIH-bih-lee”) was named in reference to her role as a goddess with this familial relation. Cybele may have been based on an Anatolian goddess who took this familial role in Çatalhöyük (“chah-tahl-HOY-ook”), and goddesses in this familial role often represented nature and fertility.
During the introduction of Cybele to Rome, this Roman towed a ship that had been stuck on sandbar to shore and became the center of a Roman cult. She was honored as the most virtuous Roman woman along with Scipio Nasica (“SKIP-ee-oh nah-SEE-kuh”), the best man.

Frey gives his sword to his servant Skirnir and tells him to help him woo this giantess, who Frey had seen while sitting on Odin’s throne. This giantess is unimpressed by offers of gold, but gives in after Skirnir threatens her with curses.
In Sweden, Frey’s cult often featured processions of wagons carrying idols of him to bless the fields, a tradition that might be linked to the cult of this older Germanic fertility goddess described in Tacitus’s Germania. Her name may indicate a connection to the Norse sea god Njörd (“nyord”).

Answer some questions about disguises Zeus took when seducing women other than Hera, for 10 points each:
Zeus took the form of a satyr when seducing this woman, who later birthed twins that her uncle forced her to leave near Mount Cithaeron (“SITH-uh-ron”). The mortal father of those twins, Epopeus, was a king of the city of Sicyon (“SIH-shee-on”) that became this woman’s cult site.
Callisto was turned into a bear after Zeus seduced her while disguised as this goddess, with whom Callisto had been hunting. This goddess of the hunt was the sister of Apollo.
Zeus fathered the Muses when he seduced Mnemosyne (“ni-MOSS-in-ee”) in the form of a member of this profession.

The binding of Loki is told in both the Lokasenna and this first section of the Prose Edda, in which the namesake king tries to find out about the nature of the Aesir and learns about a lot of Norse myths.
The Gylfaginning describes the binding of Loki as revenge for his killing of this god, which Loki causes by giving the blind Hodr an arrow tipped with mistletoe and guiding him to shoot his brother.
